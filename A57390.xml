            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Was not ignorant when firſt I undertook this
<hi>task,</hi> and buſied my ſelf to compaſs this <hi>Work,</hi> how difficult it would prove to be in it <hi>ſelf;</hi> what ſlender furtherances I had to accompliſh the <hi>ſame;</hi> and how weak my own abilities were to give <hi>it</hi> perfection: Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe obſtacles, when I had duly conſider'd the general want
<hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> and the common benefit and advantage that would redound
<hi>thereby,</hi> eſpecially to Merchants; I reſolv'd to take <hi>the ſame</hi> in hand, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and willingly laid both my hand to the
<hi>Work,</hi> and my ſhoulder to the burthen, collecting and gathering with laborious induſtry, and induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious labour, all thoſe principal points and heads, as might either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the accompliſhment of <hi>the Building,</hi> or any way further my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Fabrick:</hi> So that by my continual toil, and ſearch after fit and apt materials, I hoped that at length a good iſſue would crown my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and finiſh this my intended undertaken <hi>task.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after long and tedious inquiſition, I found that the farther I ſailed in this <hi>Ocean,</hi> the vaſter were my deſires, and the fewer were my further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to my wiſhed <hi>Port;</hi> ſo that perceiving the <hi>Work</hi> thus to increaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, beyond my expectation and firſt purpoſe, I was conſtrained (with the wind-ſcanted

<hi>thereby;</hi> all theſe I ſuppoſe are effectual inducements to challenge a fair acceptance from you. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe real arguments I cannot deny, but the <hi>Work it ſelf</hi> may not only ſuffer in the opinion of the cenſorious, but be alſo ſubject to the verdict of the judicious. But I am certain the foundation of it is laid upon the Knowledge of Geography, and the uſe of Maps and Sea-Cards in General: So delightful, profitable and neceſſary to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the ſtudy of which muſt not be neglected by any Perſon who would be eſteem'd an expert Trader.</p>
                  <p>In raiſing our Structure; I deſcribe, Firſt the Empires, Kingdoms and Republicks of this habitable World; Next the particular Provinces of each; and then the moſt celebrated Towns of Traffick therein, together with their natural Products, Artificial Commodities and Manufactures.</p>
                  <p>Then I have given an Account of the ſeveral Coins there in uſe and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, with the Value and Denomination of them, and the Species where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Merchants do there frame and regulate their Accompts by; alſo the Weights and Meaſures of thoſe places, together with their Exchanges, and how thoſe are found to be calculated amongſt the <hi>Italians</hi> who are accounted the moſt expert Bankers and Exchangers in the World.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I have added a Table of the <hi>Longitude</hi> and
<hi>Latitude</hi> of all theſe <hi>eminent</hi> Places of <hi>Traffick,</hi> not only thereby to ſatisfie the curious, but the better to guide the inquirer to any ſuch <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Town</hi> ſought for.</p>
                  <p>And, in all this <hi>Work</hi> my chief ambition hath been to pleaſe all <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> in general, and (if I may not be thought to judge too favourably of my own endeavours) I hope ſhall not fail therein. But I am almoſt confident, were my <hi>Labours</hi> duly weigh'd, my Work might challenge acceptance.

                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe was taught to <hi>Mankind</hi> by neceſſity, who to provide himſelf of things that were needful, gave in

                        <note place="margin">Bartering.</note>In the times of old amongſt us, and yet in theſe days in many places of <hi>America, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> manner of
<hi>Bartering</hi> was and is yet in uſe and practiſed, where though
<hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Braſs</hi> was not known nor accounted as a ſtamped <hi>Coin,</hi> yet it was then both here, and is ſtill here held in greater eſtimation than was any other <hi>commodity</hi> or <hi>mettal;</hi> the which <hi>Homer</hi> inferreth in his relation of the
<hi>Trojan</hi> War, where <hi>he</hi> mentioneth that <hi>Achilles</hi> his
<hi>Golden</hi> Armour was valued in <hi>barter</hi> at <hi>one hundred Oxen,</hi> and that the <hi>Braſs</hi> Armour of <hi>Diomedes</hi> was valued in <hi>barter</hi> but at <hi>nine:</hi> But <hi>Man</hi> in proceſs of time, finding it too too difficult a thing, and too too troubleſome a buſineſs, to carry about him, all things thus <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd</hi> and <hi>trucked</hi> from one place to another, choſe out <hi>one ſingular thing,</hi> which as a common <hi>ſtandard</hi> or meaſure, ſhould countervail and be in Value as all other things, and which ſhould be received and accounted of in
<hi>payment, ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>equivalency</hi> to all others; and the things thus choſen and eſtimated, was <hi>Gold, Silver</hi> and
<hi>Braſs,</hi> the moſt excellent of Metals, which being then and ſince, by the Authority of princes, divided into great and ſmall pieces, and into ſeveral and diſtinct parts and denominations, was ſtamped and coined with ſeveral <hi>characters,</hi> to denote thereby the true weight and value of the ſame; the which was firſt done by <hi>Servius</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> of
<hi>Braſs,</hi> whereon was imprinted the Image of Sheep and Oxen, betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wealth and riches of thoſe days, as <hi>Moneys</hi> do now with us; and becauſe that ten of thoſe pieces was then called a
<hi>Denier,</hi> therefore it is that univerſally all ſuch Moneys are ſtill called by the Latines <hi>Denarii:</hi> this being then the
<hi>original</hi> of <hi>Moneys,</hi> which afterward came to be coined both of
<hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>Gold;</hi> as I ſhall more at large have occaſion to demonſtrate in the Chapter of <hi>Moneys,</hi> in this following Treatiſe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Bargaining.</note>This <hi>firſt</hi> ſort of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> or Commerce then, as I ſaid before; termed
<hi>Bartering</hi> or <hi>Trucking,</hi> of one Commodity for another, begat conſequently by the means of <hi>Moneys</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> manner of
<hi>Negotiation,</hi> which is <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>ſelling,</hi> or
<hi>bargaining;</hi> for all <hi>Merchants</hi> that would tranſport Commodities from one Country or place to another, to effect the ſame, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either other Commodities, wherewith to <hi>barter.</hi> and ſo to procure them, or <hi>Money,</hi> and ſo to buy them; and therefore to facilitate
<hi>Merchandizing,</hi> and to take away the incommodity and danger of the carriage of <hi>Moneys,</hi> about a man, or from place to place, a mean was invented to have the <hi>ſame</hi> in what Country a man pleaſed, without trouble or danger of the tranſport, carriages or rigor thereof;
<note place="margin">Exchanging</note>and this was found to be beſt performed by <hi>Exchange,</hi> which is the <hi>third</hi> ſort of
<hi>Commutation;</hi> the which is noted to be no other than the giving of ſo much <hi>Moneys</hi> in one place to one, who ſhould cauſe it to be again repaid in another place by another for him; as for example, <hi>Edward</hi> hath here in <hi>London</hi> one thouſand pounds, and deſireth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame, or have it in the hands of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who reſideth in
<hi>Venice;</hi> and <hi>Lodowick</hi> hath one thouſand pounds in
<hi>Venice,</hi> in the cuſtody and hands of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which he would get, receive, and recover out and have them here: it happeneth that
<hi>Edward</hi> meeteth with <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> to whom he delivereth and payeth the ſaid one <hi>thouſand pounds;</hi> and thereupon
<hi>Lodowick</hi> writeth to <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he pay the ſaid thouſand pounds to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and thus each party comes to be both ſatisfied and accommodated; by which it may be diſcerned, that in all
<hi>Exchanges,</hi> there is concluded two payments, two places, and four diſtinct perſons; as he who payeth in the one place, and he who receiveth in the other; and he who receiveth in the one place, and he who payeth in the other; and from hence it conſequently followeth, that no man can
<hi>remit</hi> except there be another to <hi>draw;</hi> nor no man can in the ſecond place <hi>receive,</hi> except there be another authorized to
<hi>pay,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Exchanges drawn into a profitable Art, and the reaſons thereof.</note>In this manner then came in uſe the original of
<hi>Exchanges,</hi> purpoſely invented to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Trade and
<hi>Commerce,</hi> the which at firſt was practiſed without either benefit or loſs, or any other conſideration; and to render again the ſelf-ſame ſum and parcel as was received: but other conſideration; and to render again the ſelf-ſame ſum and parcel as was received: but in proceſs of time it came to be conſidered, that the giver or deliverer of the Money came both to loſe a certain ſpace in time ere the ſame was repaid, and did alſo run a certrin riſgo in the<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98306:8"/>payment thereof, which the receiver or drawer enjoyed, and profited by; and therefore it was held reaſonable that the deliverer ſhould have ſome fruit and benefit, in requital and ſatisfaction thereof, which afterward occaſioned that the ſecond payment came to be ſomewhat greater than the former; and that in conſideration thereof there ſhould be reſtored, more than was received: The endeavour of this gain then hath converted <hi>Exchanges</hi> ſince into an <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> from whence it proceedeth, that many are found at this day to <hi>remit</hi> and <hi>deliver Moneys,</hi> to the intent, to have the ſame returned with benefit, and not for a need or neceſſity to have it more in one place than in another; and many again are found to be <hi>takers</hi> and <hi>drawers,</hi> not with intent to
<hi>withdraw</hi> or recover their <hi>Money,</hi> from another perſon, or place; but to ſerve themſelves and their occaſions with that of others, for a certain time, paying and allowing for the ſame, that conſideration and intereſt as is agreed upon, and covenanted between them; which really and in effect is nothing elſe but a certain kind of <hi>permitted Uſury,</hi> and therefore by ſome accounted as a thing unlawful, though by many, and by the common and received pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the World, it is upheld and maintained with many ſolid reaſons and ſubſtantial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; beſides which, it is conſiderable, and peradventure it may well be granted, that if it were not that there is by this <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Myſtery,</hi> a gain and profit made thereof, very few <hi>Exchanges</hi> would preſent; becauſe that
<hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>remittances</hi> would in this nature but ſeldom happen, that would or might any way be available to Traffick and
<hi>Commerce,</hi> and leſs benefit would conſequently redound to the publick and univerſal <hi>Commerce</hi> of Kingdoms: and therefore though the intention of particular <hi>Exchanges,</hi> be not always found good herein, yet the general good effect which <hi>it</hi> produceth, and that proceedeth therefrom, is in <hi>it</hi> ſelf and in the true uſe and cuſtom

                        <note place="margin">Six parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a compleat City.</note>An abſolute and compleat City or Town, as ſome learned have ſet down and expreſſed, cannot ſubſiſt of it ſelf without ſix principal parts and helps, for the ſupportation thereof; and without which no City or Town can properly be ſaid to be, or to have a being; <hi>Firſt, It</hi> muſt have Victuals to feed and nouriſh <hi>it;</hi> and this is the proper task and duty of the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi> and <hi>Shepherd. Secondly, It</hi> muſt have Arms and Armour to defend <hi>it,</hi> and offend
<hi>its</hi> Enemies; and this is the proper task and duty of the Souldier.
<hi>Thirdly, It</hi> muſt have<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98306:9"/>Wealth and Riches, as ſinews for <hi>its</hi> imployment, in private and publick affairs; and this is the proper task and duty of the <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>eminent Inhabitants</hi> of this City. <hi>Fourthly, It</hi> muſt have Juſtice for Criminal and Civil Cauſes, to puniſh the bad, and reward the good; and this is the proper task and duty of <hi>Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Senators</hi> of
<hi>State. Fifthly, It</hi> muſt have Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Worſhip of GOD duly and reverently performed in it; and this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per task and duty of the Prieſthood: And <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To make <hi>it</hi> a compleat, able, and abſolute City, <hi>it</hi> muſt have Trade and Arts, practiſed therein, and this is the proper task and duty of the <hi>Merchant</hi> and
<hi>Artificer</hi> that inhabit it. Now, though many Cities are ſeen ſometimes defective in ſome of theſe parts, and are not ſo well furniſhed as this rule and the exactneſs of a compleat City requireth; yet it is daily manifeſted to the judicious and learned in <hi>Policies</hi> of State, and Government of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> that <hi>Merchants,</hi> and ſuch as exerciſe the Trade of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> in Cities, do ſupply by their endeavours and abilities by <hi>Traffick,</hi> moſt of thoſe other parts and helps here before ſpecified; and which are or may be found deficient and wanting therein.
<note place="margin">The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants purſe and perſon ſupplies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defects in a City of Trade.</note>For ſetting aſide the Worſhip and Service of God, which is only fit and proper to <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> the perſon and purſe of the <hi>Merchant</hi> ſupplies in a fair meaſure all the other parts before-mentioned; for firſt, the <hi>Merchants</hi> Navigation, and <hi>Traffick,</hi> is ſeen to ſupply the City with <hi>Corn, Grain, Cloth,</hi> &amp;c. and all manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, both for back and belly, delight and ornament, tending either to pleaſure or need; and this way he performs the part of the

<hi>Ammunition,</hi> either offenſive or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive; and thus far he performs the part of <hi>Souldier:</hi> His <hi>Traffick</hi> likewiſe is ſeen to bring Riches into the common Purſe by <hi>Cuſtoms, Impoſts,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Duties;</hi> and thereby may be ſaid to perform the part of the <hi>wealthy</hi> and moſt <hi>eminent thereof.</hi> He is ſeen by his wiſdom, travel, and experience abroad, to be able oftentimes to ſit at the <hi>Stern</hi> of the Cities <hi>Government,</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vicious, rewarding the virtuous; and herein <hi>he</hi> performs the part of a <hi>Senator</hi> and <hi>Counſellor:</hi> neither yet is <hi>he</hi> wanting in many other particulars, to perform the duty of a good

                     <p>Now then, if the <hi>Merchant</hi> and the <hi>Art of Merchandizing</hi> be ſo excellent, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary in a
<hi>City,</hi> and bringeth with it ſo many benefits and commodities: how happy then is that <hi>City,</hi> where many notable and well-govern'd
<hi>Merchants</hi> are found to reſide, and where their care of their own profit is ſo neceſſarily interwoven with the care of the
<hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>'s, and <hi>its</hi> good, that to <hi>themſelves</hi> and to their Country, their labours and adventures do bring in thus mutually, not only a commodity, but alſo an honour: but to the matter; All
<hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> are not found in themſelves proper for

                        <note place="margin">What Cities are found fit for Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</note>therefore it is ſeen by experience, that <hi>Trade</hi> hath ſettled <hi>it</hi> ſelf principally in two ſorts of <hi>Cities</hi> and

                        <hi>Traffick</hi> then reſiding and abiding principally in two ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> by daily obſervation are found to be ſuch as theſe; the <hi>firſt</hi> is the

<hi>ſecond</hi> are <hi>they</hi> that have their ſituation within ſome Continent, and may be called <hi>Land-Towns</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> diſtant both from Sea and River. And though that in both theſe, <hi>Trade</hi> and
<hi>Commerce</hi> is obſervable to be ſettled and driven; yet the manner and common form of this <hi>Trade</hi> is found to differ much, as being both of them proper to two ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Traffick</hi> and Negociation.</p>
                     <p>

<hi>Trade</hi> obſerved then to be driven in <hi>Sea-Towns</hi> or

<hi>Merchandize</hi> by that commodiouſneſs, from one <hi>place</hi> to
<hi>another;</hi> which is indeed the moſt proper and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary way, whereby <hi>Traffick</hi> is in theſe days ſeen to be maintained and preſerved; for in many <hi>places</hi> thus ſituated, it is noted that eminent <hi>Merchants</hi> do reſide, who by reaſon of this Neighbourhood of the Sea, and conſequently of Navigation, do hold a correſpondency and
<hi>Trade</hi> from one fit <hi>place</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> over all the known parts of the habitable World, Importing the Commodities of all other Countries, and Exporting the native Commodities of the place it ſelf; and of this ſort is <hi>Maſilia, Amſterdam, Genoa, Venetia, Sevil, Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, London,</hi> and many others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Alſo it muſt be without any faults both in corners or ſides, and every one of the four corners ſharp and clean cut without any naytneſs, and of a good water-cryſtalline, and ſhining clear, not yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or brown, blewiſh or blackiſh, but clear and clean in all perfection. Then we may ſay, a Diamond thus perfect weighing one Carot, is worth 50 Ducates, but now much altered from that value to double the ſame, as a Diamond of that perfection before ſpoken of, weighing 1 Carot, is worth
30, 35, or 40 <hi>lib.</hi> Sterling; but a Diamond not ſo perfect (though a good Stone) clean, and wanting a corner, is in eſtimation leſs worth by 10 Ducats, or according to Arbitrament of the Buyer. Note alſo, that ſome Diamonds are not worth paſſing 34, 35, or 36 Dollars a Carot, which are likewiſe bought by the Merchant, as the humour leads him. But when you will value a Diamond, you muſt look effectually of what water and faſhion it is, as the beſt proportion is either the ſquare Table or pointed, then if it hath all his depth (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Art, <hi>Full-ground</hi>) which is ſoon ſeen in a Stone unſet, and eaſily diſcerned in one ſet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98306:16"/>in a Ring or Jewel; for being a full-ground Stone, it ſtandeth upon his Tent, as you ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive by the reflection of the Collet the Stone ſtands in; otherwiſe being a half-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound Stone, or a thin Stone, it ſtandeth upon Velvet, which is eaſily perceived by any that is well verſed in the ſetting or ſelling of Diamonds; then if it be foul, or want corners, or any hair or other fault in it, the damage and hurt that it bringeth to the value of the Stone is bated in the price of the firſt Carot (if it be a Stone of a greater weight) and ſo ſhall you not be ſo ſoon deceived as otherwiſe. You muſt firſt underſtand, that the value and price of a perfect Diamond, or any other Precious Stone, is firſt valued from a Carot weight being 4 Grains, as aforeſaid, the which is the ground-work for the Merchant or Jeweller to value a Diamond by, to know the Price thereof.</p>
                     <p>Then the half Carot weight is in value the price of the fourth part of a Carot; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If the Carot be worth 40 Ducates, then the fourth part is 10 Ducates, which is the price of a Diamond of half a Carot; ſo a grain is reckoned worth a fourth part of half a Carot, which is 2 Ducates and a half, after the rate of 40 Ducates the Carot, as aforeſaid; and ſo you may value a Diamond or other Stone at any price whatſoever the Carot ſhall be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, weighing never ſo much.</p>
                     <p>So that if you have a Diamond that weigheth more than a Carot, as a Carot and half, or a Carot and 1 Grain; then take this for a General Rule, that you muſt bring the weight of your Carot and half Carot all into half Carots; and ſo in like manner, if it be a Carot and a Grain, you muſt bring both into Grains; As for Example, If you have a Table Diamond in all Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is aforeſaid, weighing one Carot, be worth 40 Ducates, (or any other ſum you will value a perfect Diamond at) then ſhall a Diamond of
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 Carots, be worth at that rate, as followeth: As ſuppoſe it be 2 Carots, multiply that by 2, it makes 4, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by 40 Ducates (the value we here take for a Diamond of 1 Carot) and it produceth 160 Ducates, being the value of a perfect Diamond of 2 Carots; ſo you may value all Diamonds of any weight if it be 100 Carots or more, by multiplying the weight by ſo much more, and multiply that product by the value of your Carot. Secondly, If you have a Table Diamond of 2 Carots and half, then bring the Carots and half Carots into half Carots, which is 5 half Carots, then multiply that 5 by 5 make 25 half Carots, which multiply by 10 Ducates, the fourth part of 40 Ducates, the price of a Carot amounteth to 250 Ducates, which is the true value of a Diamond weighing 2 Carots and half. Thirdly, If you have a Table Diamond of 7 Grains, which is 1 Carot and 3 Grains, then bring the Carot and Grains into Grains, and multiply it one by the other, ſaying 7 times 7 is 49 Grains, which is to be multiplied by the fourth part of the half Carot being reduced, and half and the product is the value of the ſaid Diamond of 7 Grains, which is 127 Ducates. Again, ſuppoſe you value a Diamond at 30
<hi>l.</hi> Sterling (as one of that weight of former goodneſs is now worth in <hi>London</hi>) and according to that rate a Diamond is worth 1 <hi>l.</hi>
17 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling; which Rule is now followed by thoſe that Trade in them, although you cannot buy a Table Diamond of 1 gr. under 2
<hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, which is after the rate of 40 or 48 pound a Diamond of 1 Carot.</p>
                     <p>Again, I would know the value of a perfect Table Diamond of 10 Carots, according to the rate of 30 <hi>l.</hi> a Diamond of 1 Carot: Do thus, Multiply the weight of your Diamond by it ſelf, which is 10 by 10, and it produceth 100, which multiply by 30 <hi>l.</hi> the price of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of 1 Carot, the product is 3000 <hi>l.</hi> the price of a Diamond of 10 Carots.</p>
                     <p>Again, I deſire to know the price of a Table Diamond weighing 10 Carots and 1 Grain, bring all into Grains and they make 41, which multiply by it ſelf makes 1681; this multiplied by the value of 1 Grain, which is 1 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and the product will be
3151 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The value of a Diamond of any weight from 1 Grain to 8 Carots, according to the value of a Diamond of 1 Grain to be worth 1 <hi>l.</hi> 17
<hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> may be ſeen in this following Table.</p>

                        <hi>Unio</hi> is the Latin word (in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pearl) ſo called, for that it is a hard matter to find two Pearls alike for bigneſs, figure, ſhape, water, and brightneſs. The greateſt and better ſort of Pearl are found between <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Buzera</hi> in the Straits of <hi>Perſia.</hi> There is alſo a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Pearl near the Iſland of <hi>Zeilam,</hi> but of lower price: Likewiſe there are Pearls found near the Iſland of <hi>Burneo,</hi> and Iſland of <hi>Anian;</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Ormus</hi> ſurpaſs them all. They are fiſhed for by divers that dive into the Sea, ſome 10, 15, and 10 fathom deep; they grow in Oyſter-ſhells; the Divers have Baskets tied to their back to put the Oyſters in, and bring them up from the bottom of the Sea, and put them into Boats; the fiſh are laid in the Sun, and there open themſelves; and when the fiſhing is over for that day, the Captain and Souldiers for the King of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> together with the Divers and Labourers, take the Pearls, and divide them into four parts, one of which is taken for the King, the ſecond for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Souldiers, the third for the Jeſuits (whoſe Cloyſter is hard by) and the fourth for the Divers, Fiſhers, and their Labourers. This fiſhing is only in the Summer-time; there is found in ſome Oyſters 200 Grains or Pearl. Pearls are ſold by the <hi>Indians</hi> by Sieves of Latton full of holes, from ſmaller to greater, to the proportion of 12, one bigger than the other; and ſo the price in proportion accordingly; the ſmalleſt ſorts are uſed by Apothecaries for Medicine. They uſe in <hi>India</hi> where they are fiſhed, to have Rice beaten ſmall with Salt, with which they rub the Pearl to put a gloſs upon them.</p>
                     <p>The way to value Oriental Pearl from a Grain in weight to any bigneſs whatſoever; as alſo they are uſually ſold in the
<hi>Indies</hi> and with us. A Pearl that is in all parts perfect both of water, gloſs, and beauty, without knobs, ſpecks, yellowneſs, and other imperfection; of form very round, or like a Pearl, being of the weight of one Carot, is worth one Ducate; and after this rate you are to make your reckoning, as you have done before with Diamonds and Rubies; but if there be any fault in the water, clearneſs, faſhion, knobs, ſpecks, dents, or other default, it muſt be conſidered what hurt it may be to the ſale thereof, and according to the goodneſs or badneſs value the price thereof,; which having valued, you try the weight thereof, or by your meaſure exactly made (there being ſuch for that purpoſe) and then make your account, as before is ſaid; and if there be a whole ſtring or chain, you muſt look well upon them if they be all alike, or elſe make your value thereafter.</p>

                     <p>The Coins of the <hi>Romans</hi> were of Gold, Silver, and Copper; thoſe of Silver was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius,</hi> taken by the

<hi>l.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 3. was in uſe with them in the 585th year of the City (as alſo the Braſs Coins) five years before the firſt
<hi>Punick</hi> Wars. The proportion then betwixt the Silver and Braſs, in reſpect of Weight, was very ſtrange; for the <hi>Denarius</hi> of Silver was the ſeventh part of the ounce, and the ounce the twelfth part of the pound, and yet was eſteemed in value equal to 10 <hi>aſſes,</hi> which was a Braſs Coin of a pound weight; ſo that one pound in Silver was eſteemed to 840 pound in Braſs. When their Coins of Gold came in uſe, it was eſteemed ten times the weight in Silver; but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between Silver and Braſs laſted not long; and the <hi>Denarius</hi> of Silver in proceſs of time ſuffered ſo many diminutions, that at length it had left only a Name, and of ſo ſmall a value as not worth the coining.</p>
                     <p>The like alteration in reſpect of weight hath befallen in far leſs time our own Coin; as to inſtance in our Penny, which we find in the time of <hi>Ethelred,</hi> and ſo continued to <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. to be the

                     <p>Then mark upon the <hi>line</hi> AB the length of the
<hi>Meaſure</hi> of the other Place, with his allowance, which is for Example from B to F, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt in the 900 parts; therefore 900 of thoſe
<hi>Meaſures</hi> in the firſt Place, make juſt 1000 of thoſe
<hi>Meaſures</hi> in the other Place: but if the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the other Place be longer than the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of the firſt place; as for Example: If it were from B to G, then take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of AG with a Compaſs, and ſet one foot in C, and extend the other towards A, which for Example doth come to reſt in F, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 150 parts from C; therefore then 1150

                     <p>He that intendeth then by his Pen to teach the

<hi>Merchant,</hi> nor yet addict himſelf to this knowledge: for any one
<hi>Senſe</hi> being either depraved or defective in part or in whole, will inforce him to commit (againſt his will and mind) many Errors, and conſtrain him to take the bad for good, or (at leaſtwiſe) the bad as ſoon as the good; and ſometimes (as we ſay) <hi>Chalk</hi> for
<hi>Cheeſe,</hi> or one thing for another:
<note place="margin">All commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are known by the Senſes.</note>for Experience tells us, That all <hi>Commodities</hi> are not learned by one <hi>Senſe</hi> alone, though otherwiſe never ſo perfect; nor yet by two, but ſometimes by three, ſometimes by four, and ſometimes by all: and yet this <hi>Art</hi> is now adays come to that height, (I may ſay) to that height of cunning, that all theſe are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough too.</p>
                     <p>But in general it muſt be granted, That the <hi>Eye</hi> above all the reſt of the Senſes, ſtill claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an eſpecial intereſt and prerogative herein, and muſt ever be admitted as one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that muſt ſtill accompany the reſt in this

<hi>ſaleable</hi> that are pleaſing thereto; and in ſome

                     <p>Some are noted again to require the Senſe of

                        <p>It is a cleanſing, ſevering, ſorting and dividing of the good from the bad, and to ſeparate each ſort according to the qualities of the ſeveral Commodities, and afterwards ſealed by the Garbler, Deputy, Clerk, chief Servant thereunto appointed, according to the Statute in that caſe made and provided: It was by the wiſdom of the Parliament <hi>in Primo Jacobi,</hi> Enacted, That no Spices, Drugs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be ſold, or put to ſale, before the ſame were ſearcht and Garb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as by the Act more at large it doth appear.</p>
                        <p>Alſo it is the Duty of the Garbler, or his Servants, to tare all ſuch Cask, Hogſheads, Barrels, Bags, Serens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein ſuch Spices, Drugs and Merchandizes are brought in, truly, juſtly, and indifferently betwixt Buyer and Seller; and therefore in former times the Work-men La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers were all ſworn, as appears by ſeveral Acts and Orders of the Court of Aldermen and Common-Council.</p>
                        <p>Alſo all wet and defective Commodities ought to be kept apart, without any mixture of good and bad, and after they are ſufficiently Garbled, to be ſealed with a Croſs-bar Seal, thereby to diſtinguiſh the good and Merchantable Commodities from ſuch as are faulty and defective, which the Buyer may eaſily obſerve by looking upon the Seal: but for as much as covetouſneſs, wherein a man being ſurprized, ſhall want knowledge how to command himſelf, may entice him to fall from all antient Orders, and practiſe ſtrange Diviſions, as well of Juſtice as Profit and Honeſty, which are never ſeparate in matters of good quality; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is juſt nor profitable, if not honeſt; and he that makes Diviſion of them, by ſetting forth and ſeparating his Actions; ſaying, this Deed is honeſt, but that Deed is profitable for me, he cannot be without fraud, and rend aſunder all equity ordained by publick Power and Authority.</p>
                        <p>Alſo to give Licenſe to any man to buy Spices Garbleable, and to Licenſe one and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to carry the ſame from place to place Ungarbled, is unlawful: alſo to take Money of Merchants before their Goods are Garbled, and to take more Money of one than of another for Garbling, is injuſtice and partiality, and to take more Money for his Fees than by the Acts of Common-Council is limited, is unlawful.

                        <p>The Antiquity of Wooll in this Kingdom hath been beyond the memory of Man, that accuſtomed uſe hath always been obſerved to make it the Seat of our wiſe and learned Judges, in the ſight of our Noble Peers, within the place where all wholſom Laws are eſtabliſhed for the good Government of this Kingdom; ſo that no Kingdom whatſoever can ſpeak ſo happily of this benefit as this Realm; who findeth it the rich mans Increaſe, and the poor mans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; who in former times ſuffered the Tranſportation thereof unto a more ingenious Nation, which made far greater benefit by their labour than thoſe whom God had freely ſent it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: That it is this time the glory of our Traffick, and maintenance of our poor, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſadds depend wholly on the ſame, whoſe bread is gained by theſe imployments; it affords Rayment, nay, rich Robes for the greateſt Princes, and alſo warm clothing for the meaneſt perſonages, and no part unprofitable or deceitful in it, but often abuſed by the wicked practices of deceitful people,</p>

                        <head>The Antiquity of the Alneger.</head>
                        <p>Before the making of Cloth within this Land, the Alneger was ordained, who exerciſed that Office upon all Cloths coming from forein parts, to meaſure and try them where they were put on Land, as only meaſurer appointed for a long time; his Authority was carried by Proclamation before any Parliament was holden;<note place="margin">2 Edw. 3. 14.</note> his Fee was not then given him, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Lord Treaſurer and Barons of Exchequer according to his pains and care; his charge was to ſee all Cloths of aſſiſe marked, and thoſe not of aſſiſe, and defective, to be taken into his hands for the King, although in the preſence of any Maior, Bailiff, or other Magiſtrate, wherein his credit and truſt repoſed by the King was explained.</p>
                        <p>Whilſt true making of Cloth endured in reaſonable manner, it was moſt credible in all parts, and ſo much deſired, that forein Merchants did uſually come into this Realm to fetch them away; but ſince deceit crept in, hath grown greater and increaſed every day, the Trade ſtill declining from bad to worſe, and now to worſt of all. What maketh thoſe now to refuſe our Cloths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to their own doors, which before time earneſtly ſought it at ours? Falſhood. The Clothier complains of his dead ſales, the Merchant complains of his loſſes, all but falſhood. Bad Wares are the breeders of bad Debts, and deſperate hazards, wherewith both Merchants and makers are extreamly puniſhed; when defective Cloth is made, the owner is often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to barter for as bad a Commodity, a Hilding for a Jade; or to deliver out that ſweet Herb Thyme, but receive a back burden of the bitter Herb Rue: ſo here is an adventure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. The Law was effectually provided for the ſearch in all points, that in every place where Cloth is made and ſold, perſons appointed for the ſearch thereof, that it be according to the Law; and thoſe Searchers to be able and ſufficient men in knowledge and skill, and to be ſworn to do uprightly. By which may appear, that the original and proper Office of the Alneger was to view and prevent the falſe making of all ſorts of Woolen Clothes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not retail his Seals to Clothiers to be put upon what he pleaſeth.</p>
                        <p>When the uſe of Clothing was planted here, ſome in all parts of the Realm undertook the Profeſſion; the number was but ſmall for a long time, but found ſuch good ſucceſs on their labours, as they mightily increaſed in fame and riches; chief comforters to the aged, and trainers up of youth; their Houſes frequented; their Tables repleniſhed; their Hoſpitality bountiful, and in their carriage plain and honeſt, yet with plenty and content; Noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98306:26"/>have been highly pleaſed with their entertainment; then was true dealing held in great eſtimation, and deceit hatefully loathed: theſe men commonly made their recourſe to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> weekly, who might have been ſtrangers one to another in regard of their diſtance in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet proved Brethren by reaſon of their Profeſſion; their conference of meeting was to uphold their credit by truth, and their care how to ſuppreſs falſhood, leſt it ſhould ſteal into their Trades; happieſt was he that could win moſt commendation by deſert; ſo that their works made their markets, and their Merchants their Suiters to hold on their cuſtom; whilſt this courſe continued, the Trade flouriſhed, and Gods bleſſing abounded on all Dealers therein; we have preſident within this Realm to lead us to a true courſe from that Nation which were our firſt Tutors to the Trade, who now make a Commodity among us of Wooll; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſlightneſs and ſmall value, might be eſteemed unworthy of wearing; yet by their good obſervation in making, ſearching, and ſealing, it is ſo upheld and maintained, that it is more vended than any Cloth we make, and ſo far void of deceit, that any man though unskilful may buy it without prejudice or loſs; look into their lives and conditions, and you ſhall find them loving one towards the another, and harmleſs to all men; they keep together, and diſperſe not in many places, to the end one Government ſhall rule them, but in two places, or there do they make their Congregation;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Colcheſter, Sandwich,</hi> and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                           </note> where it were a wonder to behold ſo many to maintain themſelves on ſo ſlight a Trade, yet never a beggar amongſt them; they have no Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law to bind them, but orders amongſt themſelves, which are ſo duly executed without partiality, that the rich are not favoured, nor their poor oppreſſed; their ſearch in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is threefold, one from the Loom, one from the milling, or thickning, and one from the dreſſing; and where offence is made, there puniſhment is ſure: what would theſe people do if they had the making and ordering of our rich Cloths, of great value, that can bring ſuch ſlight ware in that eſtimation?</p>
                        <p>A Statute was made concerning the abuſes of Clothes, wherein orders were provided, that all ſorts of Cloths ſhould be truly ſearched, and their juſt contents of length and weight ſet upon every piece with the word <hi>ſearched,</hi> upon forfeiture:<note place="margin">39
<hi>Eliz.</hi> 20. 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 10.</note> This Law intended the general good and Reformation of all; yet in regard there was but two Counties nominated, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Circuit expreſſed, which did before time moſt offend in thoſe points: all offenders in other places would ſtop that Law from going any farther; wherefore the next Parliament following, underſtanding that Law to concern the general good, as well as unto the former limitation, did make the ſame Act reſpectively extend unto all and ſingular Woollen Broad-Cloths, half-Cloths, Kerſies, Cottons, Dozens, Peniſtones, Frizes, Rugs, and all other Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Cloths of what nature, kind or name ſoever they be, or ſhall be made, and to be made within this Realm, to be viewed, ſealed and ſearched, and ſubjected to penalties, in ſuch like manner and form, and to ſuch purpoſes and intents reſpectively was limited to thoſe Cloths provided for in the former Laws. Now whether can theſe new Draperie fly to ſhrowd themſelves from the reach of the Law? their new names cannot help them; if they be called by any name, the Law takes hold of them, they can then plead no priviledge to free them from this Law and order, but in yielding obedience.</p>

                        <p>The chief Port is <hi>James</hi> City, a Town lying about 40 miles up in <hi>James</hi> River, which is commonly the place of the Governours Reſidence, and where the principal matters relating to Government, and the Adminiſtration of Juſtice for the whole Countrey are tranſacted, by the Governour and his Council, four times a year, called quarter Courts; and once a year by the General Aſſembly, who likewiſe meet there, being ſuch Burgeſſes as are elected in the ſeveral Counties by the people, and ſent thither to ſit and act in the nature of our Parliaments here in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98306:29"/>
                           <hi>London.</hi> Matters of leſſer conſequence are heard and determined in the ſeveral Counties by Commiſſioners authorized for that purpoſe, called the County Courts, who ſit every month, or every two months; In which Courts and all others, their trials and proceedings are in all reſpects conformable, as near as may be, according to the Laws and practice of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The climate, weather and ſoil, are much what like ours in
<hi>England;</hi> only the Summer about a month longer; ſomething hotter, and much more of Thunder and Lightning; the days about an hour and half ſhorter in Summer, and ſo much longer in Winter.</p>
                        <p>The Land fertile, plain, and ſo free from Rocks, Stones and Gravel, that their Horſes are never ſhod. <hi>Engliſh</hi> fruits proſper ſo well, that they have already attained to make ſtore of Cider and Perry. The Countrey in all parts woody; the Trees generally tall, and many of them very big, moſt of them Oaks of ſeveral ſorts, and black and white Walnuts; the reſt Poplar, Aſh, Pine, Cedar, Logwood, Gum, Cheſnut, Saxafras, Mulberry, Chinkapins, Perſimons, beſides Shoomack, Small-nuts, ſtore of wild Grape-Vine, and other ſmall ſhrubby trees and buſhes.</p>
                        <p>All ſorts of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattel prove well, and they are well ſtockt and ſtored with Horſes, Neat, Cattel of all ſorts, Sheep, Hogs, Poultry, Turkies, Geeſe and Ducks, beſides that which the Countrey naturally produces of wild Beaſts in the Woods, <hi>viz</hi> Deer, Turkies, Roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons, Poſſums, Hares, Squirrels, wild Cats, Foxes, Bears, Wolves, ſome few Lions, and in ſome part of the Countrey Elks: And in the Rivers (where the tide ſwells not above three or four foot, unleſs forced by an Eaſterly ſtorm concurring with the Spring-tide) there is in all places ſome; but in many places great plenty of Oyſters, Crabs, Sturgeon, and ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh</p>
                        <p>There is little or no Money uſed among them, but what they have is the ſame with ours here, and paſſes at the ſame value; their general way of dealing being to barter or exchange one Commodity for another, both among themſelves, and with the Merchants who bring or ſend in Goods from hence, or from any other place: excepting in Trade with the Natives or
<hi>Indians,</hi> there is <hi>Roanoke</hi> and <hi>Wampampeak,</hi> which is a ſhell cut like Beads put upon ſtrings, and paſſes among them for their Money at a certain rate by the arms length.</p>
                        <p>The Weights and Meaſures of all ſorts are in all reſpects the ſame for all ſorts of Goods with ours in <hi>London,</hi> excepting the <hi>Indian</hi> Corn or Maiz, which is commonly bought and ſold by the Barrel, the Barrel being five Buſhels <hi>Wincheſter</hi> meaſure. But the <hi>Indians</hi> among themſelves and to us, do buy and ſell their Corn, Peaſe and Beans, by a Basket, of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of half a Buſhel, or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>The principal Commodities produced there, are Tobacco, Hides, Beaver, Otter, Musk-Rat, Bear, and Deer-skins, Saxafras, Black-Walnut-tree-plank, with which Goods there are about 40 Sail of Ships laden from thence yearly, moſt of them Ships of 300, and ſome of 400 Tun burthen, therehath been ſometimes Wheat, Flax and Silk ſent from thence; but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto not much of thoſe Commodities, there being as yet but few people, and they not ſo well fitted for, nor ſo well vers'd in the ordering of them, eſpecially Flax and Silk; which proſper ſo well in thoſe parts, that in a few years, we may in all likelihood expect conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantities of thoſe Goods from thence.</p>
                        <p>There's nothing of any Cuſtom, or other Impoſition, upon any thing Imported there, or Exported from thence; their Trade being chiefly with <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Briſtol:</hi> Enough, if not a great deal too much, being laid upon the Goods here, <hi>viz.</hi> 2. <hi>d.</hi> for every pound of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco Cuſtom and Exciſe; 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every skin of Beaver, and 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> for whatſoever is carried over thither.</p>
                        <p>The Inhabitants and Planters there, have large proportions of Land due to them, upon the Adventure of their Perſons, or Servants; that is to ſay, fifty Acres for every perſon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which is made choice of, and taken up by them, or their Aſſigns, in any place which they ſhall chuſe, not already poſſeſt, or taken up by another before; paying a quit-rent of 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every 50 Acres yearly, in Tobacco, Corn, or other Commodities, at the price cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; upon which they live, and plant what they pleaſe, without any prohibition or reſtraint; there being no other Order, Government, or Regulation in matter of Trade, but what every man hath in his own breaſt.</p>
                        <p>Linnen and Woollen Cloth of all ſorts, Nails, Iron tools, Sope, Starch, Powder, Shot, Guns, Wine, Strong-waters, Sugar, Fruit, Spice; and generally all neceſſaries for Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff and Clothing, are vended and brought in by the Ships of our Nation, in ſuch propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or quantity as is neceſſary for 16 or 18000 people, there being about that number of the

<hi>Virginia.</hi>
                           </note>The Seed of Tobacco is much eſſer than Muſtard-ſeed; it is ſowed in <hi>January</hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> in beds of rich and well-manured ground, where it ſprings up to Plants, commonly as thick as they can ſtand one by the other: the Plants being come to ſtrength, and about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Roſe, which is uſually in
<hi>May,</hi> they are tranſplanted into the midſt of little. Hills, made in Fields for that purpoſe, about three foot aſunder one from the other; ſo that there may be 4 or 5000 Hills in an Acre of ground. Sometimes if the Plants be weak, they ſet 2 or. 3 in one Hills to make ſure of one; but when once come to ſtrength, they never ſuffer above one to grow in one Hill; if they ſhould, they would but ſpoil one another. Theſe Plants grow up into ſtalks, much like Coleworts, bearing leaves one above another about half a yard long, very thick and ſappy, in ſhape much like Dock-leaves; they ſeldom let the ſtalk grow above two foot high, (except ſuch as are preſerved for Seed) the tops then being cut off, that the leaves thereon may be the better nouriſhed. The ground if well husbanded, is cleanſed from weeds with Hoes, and the Earth kept about the Plants. It is ripe in
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> then they cut up the Plants whilſt the leaves grow on them, and hang them up in houſes to dry from the heat of the Sun, which would elſe ſcorch it to powder; and in a months time, or longer, the leaves are ſtript from the ſtalk, which is done commonly in moiſt weather; and then ſit to be pack'd in Cask, or made up into Rolls. Thoſe ſtalks which are let grow for Seed, the tops are not taken off, but let run to their full length, which is four or five foot, and is ripe alſo in <hi>Auguſt:</hi> The ſtalk of Tobacco is about the bigneſs of a child's arm; and in an Acre of ground may grow fifteen hundred weight of good Tobacco.</p>

                        <p>The Governour, as alſo all other Magiſtrates, and ſubordinate Officers, are all choſen by the major part of the Free-men annually: but none is made free till firſt he is a member of ſome Congregational Church here: for their Religion is Proteſtantiſm, indifferent between Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Presbyterian: here is no Toleration for Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, nor Quakers; nor any ſuch Sectaries that are apt to ſow Sedition, or diſturb the Peace. But ſuch as will ſit down and attend the ways of God, though they join not with them, may be quiet.

                        <p>They are not yet come ſo high as to tranſport Manufactures of their own, for they cannot ſupply themſelves. The Commodities Exported, are Fiſh, Beef, Pork, Bisket, Flour, ſome Corn ſometimes, Beaver, Musk-skins, Otter-skins, Pipeſtaves, Boards, Maſts.</p>
                        <p>All ſorts of Forein Commodities will vend here, if ſuch as the Countrey affords will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them with the Commodities above expreſt, and they are ſtill cloathed with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: for the colours, the neweſt are now beſt in requeſt: for the quantity, all ſorts of courſe and fine Linnen and Woollen, Shoes, Stockings, Thread, Buttons, and Pedlery Ware; Silks, Ribonds, Lace, Pewter, Lead, Shot, Powder, ſmall Artillery; Mault, Wines, Strong-waters, Oyls, Fruits, Salt,

                        <p>Here is as yet no Society begun to encourage Trade; and the Encouragement to Manuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture will be of neceſſity as people grow numerous.

                        <p>The moſt of our Negotiation (for want of Money) is in a way of bartering, and do agree in what Commodities to pay, and at what rates and time.</p>

                        <p>The Religion is Chriſtian, and a Law eſtabliſhed there for Liberty of Conſcience, to all that profeſs to believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The Countrey is under the right Honourable
<hi>Caecilius</hi> Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> as the abſolute Lord and proprietor of it, with all the Juriſdictions anciently belonging to the Count Palatine of <hi>Durham;</hi> which Lord <hi>Baltemore</hi> holds it to him and his heirs of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as of the Caſtle of
<hi>Windſor</hi> in free Soccage by the yearly rent of two <hi>Indian</hi> arrows to be delivered at the ſaid Caſtle on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tueſday.</p>
                        <p>The place abounds with great Navigable Rivers, as
<hi>Pattowmeck, Pattuxent, Anne Arundel,</hi> (by ſome called
<hi>Severn</hi>) <hi>Patapſco</hi> River, <hi>Bolus, Saſquehannough</hi> River, <hi>Elk</hi> River, <hi>Choptanck, Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacoke,</hi> or <hi>Bever</hi> River, <hi>Pokemoke,</hi> and divers others, in which are multitudes of convenient Ports, capable of great numbers of Ships of any burthen.</p>
                        <p>There is little Money, by reaſon Barter for Commodity is more profitable to the Merchant and Inhabitant. But generally all the dealing with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one with another, is with Tobacco upon Accompt till the Crop.</p>
                        <p>They uſe generally the Weights and Meaſures of
<hi>England,</hi> and without any Tret.</p>
                        <p>The Commodities of the Country for Trade to be Exported, are generally Tobacco, and Beaver, Otter, Martin, and ſeveral other Furs purchaſed from the <hi>Indians:</hi> but they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jucting to fall upon the making of Silk: and the Country naturally yields ſtore of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-Trees to that end, and generally it hath all the Commodities that <hi>Virginia</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords.</p>
                        <p>There are nine or ten Ships laden there yearly with Tobacco's for <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cuſtom there is none, nor any Tax upon Commodities paid by the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The abuſes and defects are, if the Tobacco's be packed up too dry, or too wet, or not cloſe pack'd, or that with good leaves be mixt ground-leaves or ſuckers.

                        <p>Though they permit none of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation to Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> yet they permit them to Trade with themſelves, exacting a great Cuſtom at pleaſure for all Goods Imported and Exported, as a Recognition enforced from all Merchants to their

                        <p>The moſt vendible Commodities to be brought them, are Guns, Powder and Shot, the abovementioned ſhagged Cloth called Duffeilds, and Brandy-wine, Linnen Cloth, Shoes, Stockings, and other neceſſaries for Clothing.</p>
                        <p>Their policy is to prohibit the Importation of Guns, Powder and Shot, ſo that all Foreiners are to beware how they come there with that Commodity; for the Stranger ſhall be ſure to have it ſeized, without ſome cloſe contrivance in the landing of it; but once landed, and on the ſhore, they are ſold there in their common Shops.</p>

But for the South-Eaſt and Weſterly part of it, it is all along a Road, where Ships may Anchor and Ride; but more eſpecially, and with greater ſafety in four chief places, or Bays thereof.</p>
                     <p>The principal Road or Bay is called <hi>Carlile</hi> Bay, and lies near South-Weſt of the Iſland, near the middle of it, and is a good Road for ſhipping, where 500 Ships of any Burthen may ſafely Anchor from all but South and Weſterly winds, which very ſeldom in theſe parts happen; for the wind here generally blows from Eaſt Northerly and Southerly. Wherefore it is, that we call the Eaſt-part of the Iſland, the Windward, and the Weſt-part the Leeward. Here lies alſo the chief Town for Trade, formerly called the <hi>Bridge,</hi> but now <hi>St. Michael</hi>'s; and hath two Forts and a Platform between them, anſwering each to the other, for the preſervation and defence of the ſaid Town, and command of the Road.</p>

This Fort is built ſtrong with Stone and Lime, and hath 17 great Guns, and capable of more, being ſufficiently garriſon'd and commanded by a Captain.</p>
                     <p>The Platform joins to the Windward part of the Town, and is capable of 15 great Guns; and the other Fort lies and joins to the Leeward part of the Town, the which is capable of 25 great Guns.</p>
                     <p>The Town conſiſts of ſeveral Streets and Lanes, being about 30 Chains in length, and 15 in breadth; and hath many fair and large Buildings, moſt of them are boarded on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; ſome of them Plaiſter'd, and many the faireſt and beſt are built with Stone, and with Brick.</p>

                     <p>The fourth Road and Town was lately called <hi>Spieght</hi>'s Bay, but now <hi>Little Briſtol,</hi> which lies about four leagues to Leeward of St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, and hath two Forts.

                     <p>The growth of this Iſland and parts adjacent, as for Trade, is, Sugar, Ginger, Indico, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Wooll; alſo Tobacco, Logwood, Fuſtick, and <hi>Lignum vitae:</hi> but of theſe four laſt no quantity now to be had here; but in the <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands greater ſtore. For the firſt four, every one makes as they pleaſe; that is to ſay, few ſo good as they might, (eſpecially if intended to pay away) here being no Law of compulſion in the caſe. In ſome places of this Iſland Sugars will require five weeks to Cure in, and in other places near the Sea, three weeks the ſooneſt; but ſome will make payment of it in three or four days Curing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if refuſed by the Merchant, he may ſtay one year's time the longer, beſides the Charges of a Sute in Law e're he get it.

<hi>Goletta</hi>) is ſtrongly guarded, being about eight miles diſtant from this City.

<hi>Mahometan</hi> account) are permitted to ſet foot therein; if they do, there is no remedy, but they muſt either turn from, or burn for their Religion.</p>
                     <p>This Kingdom is much bettered and inriched by the labour of the <hi>Andaluzes,</hi> who have here built many Cities and Temples according to their ſuperſtitious uſe, planted Vines, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Limons, Figs, Dates, Almonds and Olives; and thereby have much peopled and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited the whole Countrey.</p>

                        </gap>. But theſe Gold Coins do vary much in their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue according to mens neceſſities, and the plenty and ſcarcity thereof.

<hi>Mecha,</hi> (to viſit the Sepulchre of their falſe Prophet) who for their light carriage are very inquiſitive after Gold: But they chiefly deſire Sultanies, which in divers places go current for 2 Ryals of

<hi>Commodities</hi> which they buy or barter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their own uſe, or for <hi>Merchandize,</hi> they are found to have as good judgment in them as the Sellers themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Their ignorance in <hi>Trade</hi> may be judged by their ignorance in <hi>Accompting</hi> and <hi>Reckoning,</hi> for when they have paſt the number of <hi>Ten,</hi> they rehearſe ſo many words one after another for one number, that they are ſo puzzled and cumbred therewith, that they cannot tell how to get out, and ſo ſit buzzing ſo long, till at laſt they have loſt their Tale, and forgot their number, and ſo are forced to begin to tell again: but ſince they began to trade with the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and were to reckon above the number of <hi>Ten,</hi> for they uſe no more amongſt them, they reckon on till they come to
<hi>Ten,</hi> and then take one of their fingers into their hands, and then tell to <hi>Ten</hi> again; and then take another finger into their hand, and ſo proceed till they have both their hands full, which in all maketh one

                        <hi>SUACHEN</hi> is one of the richeſt Cities of the

<hi>Aethiopia ſub Aegypto,</hi> and amongſt all the famous Cities of
<hi>Trade</hi> in the <hi>Orient</hi> this is accounted equal, if not ſuperiour to them in four things; the firſt in the goodneſs and ſecurity of the <hi>Haven;</hi> the ſecond in the facility and good ſervice for <hi>lading</hi> and <hi>unlading</hi> of Ships; the third in the
<hi>Traffick</hi> with very ſtrange and remote People and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and of divers behaviours; the fourth in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and ſituation of the
<hi>City:</hi> As for the goodneſs and ſecurity of the <hi>Port,</hi> Nature hath ſo made it, that it is defended from all ſtorms whatſoever; the <hi>Haven</hi> is capacious and large, of ſmooth Tides, the ground good, and able in circuit to hold 300 great Sail of burthen, with water at all times, from ſix to twelve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; the Ships are laden round about the whole circumference of the <hi>City,</hi> caſting only a plank into the

<hi>Diver,</hi> who hath his <hi>noſe and his ears well ſtopped and anointed with Oyl,</hi> and a basket faſtned about his neck, or under his left arm; then he ſinketh down by the ſaid rope to the bottom of the Sea, and as faſt as he can be filleth the ſaid basket, and being full, he then ſhaketh the rope, and his fellows that hold the other end, and are in their Bark, inſtantly hale him up with his filled basket, and in this wiſe they go one by one until they have laden their ſaid boat with <hi>Oyſters;</hi> and in the evening returning a ſhore to the<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98306:69"/>Village, every company maketh their own heap or mount of <hi>Oyſters</hi> by themſelves, one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from another in ſuch wiſe, that there is ſeen a great long row of mounts or heaps of <hi>Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> which remain untouched until ſuch time as the <hi>fiſhing</hi> be ended; and at the end whereof every company ſitteth down about their mount or heap, and fall to opening of them, which they may eaſily do, becauſe that then they be both dry, dead, and brittle; and if every <hi>Oyſter</hi> ſhould prove to have
<hi>Pearls</hi> in them, it would prove a very good purchaſe unto them: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are found to have no <hi>Pearls</hi> at all in them; therefore when their
<hi>fiſhing</hi> is done, they then perceive whether their ſaid
<hi>fiſhing</hi> and gathering proveth good or bad.</p>
                     <p>Now there are certain men expert in the choice and diſtinction of <hi>Pearls,</hi> which here they call <hi>Chittini,</hi> which ſet and make the price of <hi>Pearls,</hi> according to their
<hi>carracts,</hi> each <hi>carract</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four <hi>grains,</hi> and theſe with an inſtrument of Copper having holes therein of ſeveral great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſerving to diſtinguiſh the ſorts, to which alſo they conſider their <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and then thereof make four ſeveral ſorts.

<hi>Portugals</hi> by them: The ſecond ſort, which are not round, are called <hi>Aia</hi> of <hi>Bengala:</hi> the third ſort, which are not ſo good as the ſecond, they call <hi>Aia</hi> of <hi>Canora,</hi> that is to ſay, the Kingdom of <hi>Biſnagar:</hi> The fourth and laſt, and indeed the worſt ſort, they call <hi>Aia</hi> of <hi>Cambaia:</hi> and thus the price being by the men ſet thereon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſorts, goodneſs, and greatneſs, there are <hi>Merchants</hi> of every Countrey which are ready with their <hi>Moneys</hi> in their hands to buy them; ſo that in few days, all the ſaid parcels are bought up, according to the ſaid prices ſet upon them, altering according to the <hi>carract, beauty,</hi> and <hi>ſhape</hi> thereof.

<hi>Silver</hi> by the <hi>Mines</hi> thereof, which now is found ſo abundantly plentiful in the world, may be called indeed and in effect their beſt <hi>Commodity,</hi> which ever ſince its firſt coinage, they have maintained in its prime weight and ſineneſs, which many of their
<hi>Politicians</hi> have gone about at ſeveral times to inhanſe, as if it would have proved a great benefit to their Common-wealth; but wiſer judgments have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that the raiſing of theſe moneys in <hi>Spain</hi> would prove altogether prejudicial to that State; for all theſe
<hi>Commodities</hi> that are brought to them, which for the moſt part they ſtand in great need of, being neceſſary either for back or belly, would ſoon vaniſh, did not theſe their moneys allure and attract them; and contrariwiſe it may be hence imagined, and I think granted, that what other
<hi>Princes</hi> ſoever doth inhanſe his <hi>Silver,</hi> or the moneys of his Countrey, it muſt needs prove to his own proper prejudice and the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> gain, becauſe they raiſe and inhanſe a
<hi>Commodity</hi> which is not theirs really, but tranſported to them at ſecond hand by <hi>Merchants</hi> and <pb n="165" facs="tcp:98306:86"/>others, and of which though happily poſſeſſing ſome ſmall <hi>Silver Mines</hi> of their own, yet the groſs is ſtill his, ſo far forth as his quantity and abundance exceedeth theirs.</p>
                     <p>As for the other <hi>Commodities</hi> which thoſe Countreys afford, ours and many other Nations were with the ſame from
<hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> at firſt ſupplyed, and then hence, but now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the way to the Spring head, we daign not to buy of them at the ſecond hand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch, of which their <hi>Princes</hi> reſerve to themſelves a peculiar intereſt, either by farming the ſame to their Subjects, or keeping the ſame in their own hands, or by excluding all other Nation from the <hi>Trade</hi> thereof, and theſe we and others are conſtrained to have from them, in which number may be accounted <hi>Sugars, Tobacco, Ginger,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Drugs,</hi> and the
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> in general.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Inhabitants both of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Portugal,</hi> they are in general lovers of <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing</hi> and Traffick, neither ſo much deſpiſing it as the <hi>French,</hi> nor yet ſo much addicted thereto as the <hi>Italians,</hi> yet more willingly adventuring their Eſtates at Sea than them, who herein are found to diſtruſt the Providence of <hi>Almighty God</hi> in a lawful calling, and prefer their own wiſdom and providence on Land before the protection of the
<hi>Almighty</hi> at <hi>Sea.</hi> And as they are well-wiſhers to Trade, ſo are they found in a large meaſure to practiſe it in ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as occaſion and <hi>Commodities</hi> do either preſent or permit; for both in
<hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Lisbon</hi> are found <hi>Merchants</hi> of great eminency, but yet are ſuch as for the moſt part bend their Traffick into both the <hi>Indies</hi> and no where elſe, except peradventure a little to

Factors reſident but where their <hi>King</hi> is Chief and Sovereign. The <hi>Raw Silks, Wines;</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> are the prime <hi>Commodities</hi> of import it now yields, as alſo <hi>Olives, Raiſins, Figs, Almonds,</hi> &amp;c. which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> fetch from them in great abundance; ſo that it is of late years obſerved, that the Planters of theſe <hi>Fruits,</hi> and their
<hi>Wine Merchants,</hi> have by our over-greedy purchaſing of theſe
<hi>Commodities,</hi> raiſed to themſelves fair Eſtates.</p>
                     <p>Two things I obſerved during my abode here, that are great lets and impediments to the <hi>Trade</hi> of this Nation, the one is the baniſhment of the <hi>Moors</hi> that here in great numbers Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, who painfully and induſtriouſly manured their land, and by their labour and thrifty living reiſed to their Landlords and to themſelves good and great eſtates, the which now for many thouſand thouſand Acres lie waſt and deſolate, whole Towns and Villages being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate, and the <hi>Lords Caſtles</hi> and <hi>Mannors</hi> appearing ruined and decayed, want the pains of theſe poor People that gave their <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Lordſhips</hi> means of ſubſiſtency. The ſecond is the reſidence of many <hi>Genoa Merchants</hi> amongſt them, who are found in good number to abide in every good City, eſpecially on the Sea coaſts, whoſe skill and acuteneſs in <hi>Trade</hi> far ſurpaſſing the natural <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Portugals,</hi> and who by means of their wealth and continual practice of <hi>Exchanges</hi> are found to devour that bread which the Inhabitants might otherwiſe be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſed with; and by reaſon that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> is ever engaged to their Common-wealth for great and vaſt Sums at intereſt, he is their Debtor not only for their moneys, but a ſo for their favour, which by many immunities throughout his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he is found continually to requite them: and amongſt the reſt it is obſerved, That there is no <hi>Genoa Merchant</hi> reſident in <hi>Spain</hi> in any part, but hath a particular
<hi>Licence</hi> to export the <hi>Rials</hi> and <hi>Plate</hi> of this
<hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to a certain round Sum yearly, which they ſeldom uſe really to do, but ſell the ſame to other Nations, that are conſtrained to make their returns in <hi>Plate</hi> for want of other more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial commodities; which for the certain profit it is found ever to yield in other Countreys, is often preferred before all the other Commodities of this
<hi>Kingdom.</hi> A third reaſon of hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I might add hereto, which is tho <hi>current Coin</hi> wherein all <hi>Commodities</hi> are ſold and bought; for in many parts of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> being for the moſt part baſe and of <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Braſs,</hi> which to convert into
<hi>Rials</hi> and <hi>good money</hi> is found to coſt the <hi>change</hi> in ſome places 5, in ſome 10, in ſome 15, in ſome 20 <hi>per cent.</hi> which is the firſt penny. The great <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> alſo paid in many parts of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is likewiſe a great let and hinderer of
<hi>Trading</hi> in general; which wherefoever the ſame is by the
<hi>Sovereign</hi> levied, will in a ſhort time and inſenſibly devour and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Traffick,</hi> and enforce the <hi>ſuffering Merchant</hi> either totally to give over, or bend his <hi>Trade</hi> where he ſhall find the burthen thereof lighter and more eaſily to be born and endured. Now as for
<hi>Commodities</hi> which other Nations are found to bring unto them, and of which they ſtand in need partly to ſupply their own neceſſities, and partly to maintain their <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Traffick;</hi> as this
<hi>England</hi> brings them great ſtore of <hi>Newlandiſh fiſh, Iriſh Salmon, Pilchards, Herrings, Lead, Tin, Calves-skins, Baies, Saies, Serges,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh Manufactures;</hi> and in return have only thence <hi>Wines, Fruits, Oyls,</hi> ſome <hi>Indico</hi> and <hi>Sugars, Ginger,</hi> and the like <hi>India Commodities.

                     <p>It is here to be noted, That in <hi>Lucca</hi> there is paid ¼ more for the <hi>colours</hi> than for <hi>Blacks,</hi> therefore the
<hi>Cuſtom</hi> is to add for the <hi>colours</hi> that are in the parcel ¼ to the Weight, reducing them all to one Weight and Price, as if they were all <hi>Blacks:</hi> where alſo is to be obſerved, That
<hi>Crimſons</hi> and <hi>Carnations</hi> pay to ½ <hi>Livres</hi> over and above the ¼ before mentioned, but being mixt with other colours, and that either the Ground or the Flower (as in <hi>Damath</hi>) be of another colour, then they pay but the half of 10 <hi>Livres</hi> beſides the above-mentioned ¼ or fourth in Weight.</p>

<hi>Silks</hi> made here, they are generally reduced to 7 <hi>Braces per l.</hi> either <hi>Sattins, Double-Taffataes,</hi> or <hi>Damasks,</hi> and if they paſs 7 <hi>Braces,</hi> they are held advantageous to the Buyer in the Meaſure; if under 7 <hi>Braces,</hi> they are held the richer, and of leſs advantage to the Buyer; the principal obſervations may be collected to lie in the <hi>richneſs of the colour, and the goodneſ of the Silk.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The Trade in general of <hi>Italy</hi> obſerved</note>NOw having run through the principal places of Traffick in
<hi>Italy,</hi> in the particular, let us note a word or two in the general, concerning not only the <hi>Traders,</hi> but alſo <hi>Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatioa,</hi> which is ſeen in many places to be a means whereby <hi>Trade</hi> it ſelf is preſerved and performed.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> then not only the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> but even the <hi>Princes</hi> entitled do profeſs themſelves to be
<hi>Merchants,</hi> without any indignity to their quality or place, which many of our Country <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> (with leave may I ſpeak it) fooliſhly diſdain, and only permit retailing of Goods to Men of the inferior ſort, and Shop keepers, but retain yet the groſs ever in their own and Servants hands, and by this courſe they are found not only to keep the
<hi>Patrimonies</hi> deſcended to them by their Anceſtors, but alſo are daily found to encreaſe the ſame, while our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> prodigal in Expence, and aſhamed to make honeſt Gain, and exerciſe an honeſt Calling, oftentimes not only deſtroy their Families, but ruin themſelves, and not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom their Poſterities. Among the <hi>Merchants</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> then, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are the chief, who in times paſt enjoyned every Ship thence departing in <hi>Trade</hi> to carry one of their
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> or <hi>Clariſſimo,</hi> who was allowed him his Diet and Paſſage; but this wiſdom of their Anceſtors is now laid aſide, and the charges thereof which is ſtill collected, is in every ſuch Veſſel beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by ſome poor <hi>Clariſſimo</hi> or other, ſo that their
<hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Navigation</hi> is thereby much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and the Mariners and moſt expert of their Seamen imployed in their ſhipping are for the moſt part <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Florentine</hi> is the next, the <hi>Duke</hi> whereof is here to be remembred, who is the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Merchant,</hi> and here not ſeldom imploys his own and others Ships for <hi>Corn, Salt,</hi> or other neceſſary Proviſions for his <hi>Dukedom</hi> and his own ſtore, thereby incouraging his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to <hi>Trade</hi> and adventure abroad: two principal things are obſerved which do much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the <hi>Merchants</hi> of
<hi>Italy,</hi> the firſt is their frequent <hi>Exchanging,</hi> wherein they are the beſt verſed in the World, the other is the <hi>Trade</hi> of their
<hi>Silks,</hi> wrought by the induſtry of the <hi>Silk-worm,</hi> which wrought into <hi>fabricks</hi> are thence diſperſed throughout
<hi>Europe,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but theſe are fetched from them by others, and not Exported by themſelves, partly by the over great affection that they have to their native Homes, and the little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire they have to Travel abroad, but principally for want of good Ships of burthen, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few Veſſels in <hi>Venetia, Naples,</hi> and
<hi>Legorn,</hi> all the <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> cannot ſhew a Ship of 100 <hi>Tuns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Naples</hi> is a large and rich Country, and
<hi>Genoa</hi> rich, though of little extent, yet the great number of
<hi>Nobility</hi> in the former, and the great <hi>Uſury</hi> practiſed in the latter, hath reduced them to a neglect of all <hi>Trade,</hi> except what the boſom of their Country doth naturally vend, that they Traffick with; and theſe being in themſelves rich, induce other Nations to bring them thoſe few things they want; for though <hi>Italy</hi> as it now ſtands, acknowledgeth many <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> yet one Country ſupplying another, ſtands in need of little from Foreigners, ſo that it may be ſaid, while they have Peace they have Plenty; ſome Proviſions of <hi>Fiſh, Corn,</hi> and <hi>Cloth, England</hi> doth furniſh them, and in return have only their
<hi>Silk Fabricks, Oils,</hi> and ſome few other Commodities, ſo that putting aſide the <hi>Trade</hi> driven thither by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as being of greateſt conſequence, the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Spaniard, French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> is but ſmall, and but of little moment amongſt them; which in particular may be thus ſurveyed; for <hi>Venice</hi> I have given you the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Trade</hi> thereof, now in the wane, and almoſt at the laſt breath, ſave where it is preſerved by their new deviſed Edicts, and the natural grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Currans,</hi> and by their ſmall <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople, Cairo,</hi> and
<hi>Aleppo</hi> by Sea, and to <hi>Auſtria, Dalmatia, Iſtria, Italy,</hi> and into the upper <hi>Germany</hi> by Land: The next part of this
<hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> is challenged by <hi>Naples,</hi> which in it ſelf affords rich <hi>Silks, Corn, Oil,</hi> and <hi>Wines,</hi> with which they ſeem to be contented, for they covet not much to Traffick among themſelves, nor yet with others further than for their meat, and drink, and clothing, which to the poorer ſort is moſt wanting.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Papacy.</hi> Her ſhare in the <hi>Trade</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> is not worth the nomination, no more is <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, Urbin,</hi> and thoſe other petty <hi>Signiories.</hi> The <hi>Tuſcans</hi> rightly demand a part, and it ſhall be granted them, both in their <hi>Florentine Fabricks,</hi> and in their privileged Town of <hi>Legorn,</hi> but I may fear it will not laſt long, for the <hi>Dukes</hi> growing both rich and covetous, and daily encroaching upon thoſe Liberties, at firſt liberally given to Strangers <hi>Merchants</hi> in <hi>Legorn,</hi> and who every day are ſeen to lay <hi>ſome new petty Duties</hi> upon the Goods there: as for
<hi>Genoa,</hi> were they as truly wiſe for the good of their Common-wealth as they are found to be to themſelves, they are of ability to do better, and to have that <hi>Trade</hi> their Neighbours now deprive them of.

                        <hi>ANtwerp</hi> is accounted the principal City of
<hi>Trade</hi> that is ſubject to the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> in all theſe parts, and having had the Prerogative above all others in times paſt; neither yet to this Day, being ſo decayed, but that in many particulars it giveth Rule to all, or the moſt of the neighbouring Cities round about, which conſidered, to abbreviate my task, I think it will not be improper that I comprehend the <hi>Trade</hi> of all thoſe Provinces that are under the Government in this Circuit to this particular City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antwerp</hi> then being ſeated upon the River of
<hi>Scheld,</hi> which by eight Channels cut, runneth through this City, is conceived to be eight Miles in compaſs; ſome of theſe Channels being able to hold 100 great Ships, which made the ſame more commodious for the Tranſport and Carriage of Wares to any part thereof. The former and ancient
<hi>Trade</hi> of this City was great and eminent, and occaſioned, as ſome have obſerved, by three means, and had its decays alſo by three occaſions. Firſt, by reaſon of two <hi>free Marts</hi> holden yearly, continuing five and forty days, during which time, no Man either in his Perſon or in his Goods could be Arreſted or moleſted for either Debt or otherwiſe. Secondly, by reaſon that the <hi>King of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> having diſcovered the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1500, and diverted the courſe of <hi>Trade</hi> driven by the <hi>Venetians</hi> from
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> to his Port of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> kept here his <hi>Factors,</hi> and ſent hither thoſe <hi>Indian Commodities</hi> to ſeek their vent, and this firſt drew the <hi>Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Adventurers</hi>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:98306:110"/>from <hi>Bruges</hi> hither to reſide. The third was the <hi>Wars</hi> that fell between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Charles the Fifth,</hi> which brought hither many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from Villages and petty Towns for ſafety ſake here to reſide and build. Now as the cauſes of her riſing have been noted to be three, ſo the cauſes of the loſs of that <hi>Trade</hi> may be reduced alſo to three.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>Wars</hi> here, and in general in theſe
<hi>Provinces</hi> between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Nation,</hi> wherein this City ſuffered pillaging, and indured the command of new Laws.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>abrogation</hi> of part of thoſe
<hi>Privileges</hi> that were granted here to the <hi>Engliſh Merchant-Adventurers</hi> and others, that the <hi>new and great Cuſtoms</hi> impoſed upon their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Merchandize.</hi>

                     <p>This Town doth conſiſt of 5 principal Streets, through which the Water doth run, and are divided therewith, in which Ships, Barges and Boats of all kinds are found both to come and go continually either to lade or unlade, which is not only beneficial to the Inhabitants, but alſo commodious and beautiful.</p>

They are accounted better for Northern Deſigns and Voyages, by reaſon of their Country's cold ſituation, than for Southern; yet their late <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and their good Succeſſes there, demonſtrate they can alſo accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to the hotter Climates.</p>
                     <p>Their Trade is generally throughout the World, in imitation of their Neighbours, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe ſteps for many Years they have followed; only in <hi>Turkey</hi> they have but ſmall <hi>Traffick,</hi> by reaſon their Countrey wants thoſe <hi>Commodities</hi> that are fit and proper for that <hi>Empire,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cloths, Lead, Tin,</hi> the main

                     <p>As for their Judgment in <hi>Traffick</hi> it is ſingular, by reaſon their want of many Neceſſaries both for Back and Belly, enforceth them to pry nearer into <hi>Commerce</hi> than other Nations that

They were few Years paſt accounted of a heavy and duller temper; but the <hi>Italians,</hi> who in foreſeeing Wiſdom and Providence, would be throughout the World accounted for
<hi>Promethei,</hi> were by them made <hi>Epimethei,</hi> as wiſe after the deed, too late repenting. For when they came firſt to ſettle their Trade in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> they took young Youths of that Nation to be their
<hi>Caſhters,</hi> and to copy their Letters, whereby they came to learn the Secrets of their <hi>Trade,</hi> and afterwards, to the <hi>Italians</hi> great Prejudice, <pb n="230" facs="tcp:98306:115"/>exerciſed it themſelves, and not contented therewith, as it were thus depriving them of the <hi>Trade</hi> of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> but they follow'd them into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there living as ſparingly as they, and diſperſing themſelves into ſundry
<hi>Provinces</hi> and principal Towns, have given a great blow to their great
<hi>Traffick</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> and that which adds much to their Knowledge and Gain, is, that they covet ſtill to buy all <hi>Commodities</hi> at the <hi>Well-head</hi> (as Merchants ſay) and where that
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi> hath its firſt original, and where the ſame is cheapeſt, and then tranſport them not ſo much to their own homes as elſewhere, where the ſame is deareſt, and not ſhaming to retail any
<hi>Commodity</hi> by ſmall Parts and Parcels, which both <hi>Engliſh Merchants</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> diſdain to do in any Countrey whatſoever; by which means they are come now to that height, that tho by nature they want all things, yet by <hi>Induſtry</hi> and
<hi>Merchandiſing,</hi> they not only ſupply their own Defects, but alſo many of their Neighbours Wants and Neceſſities, as I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſundry particulars. Neither muſt I omit one <hi>Cuſtom</hi> here uſed, and not found, I think, elſewhere in the World, that whilſt the
<hi>Husband</hi> ſports idly at home, their <hi>Women</hi> are oft-times ſeen to be the <hi>Merchants,</hi> and, in ſome <hi>Provinces</hi> here, ſail from City to City, to compaſs their Affairs abroad, as they for the moſt part are found to manage it at home: for in their Shops they ſell all, and take account of all; and it is no reproach to the Men to be never enquired after in theſe Buſineſſes of <hi>Trade,</hi> who take Moneys of their Wives for daily Expence, and gladly ſo paſs their time over in Idleneſs. Now for as much as <hi>Bruges</hi> hath been the City where in time paſt this great <hi>Traffick</hi> was cohabitant, it will not be amiſs a little to look back upon <hi>it</hi> and thoſe Times, and ſee the Glory of it in its Luſtre then, and the Decay thereof in its Ruine now.</p>

<hi>Bruges;</hi> and partly by the Fame of the large and <hi>commodious</hi> River <hi>Sceldis</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and partly by the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> then afoot in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: Firſt then the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> having taken <hi>Calicut</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> carried the
<hi>Spices</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> to the <hi>Fairs of Antwerp, Anno</hi> 1503. and contracting with that City drew the <hi>Fuggers</hi> and <hi>VVelfars,</hi> two potent <hi>German Families of Merchants,</hi> thither. After which the
<hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Florence, Lucca,</hi> and the <hi>Spinolas</hi> of
<hi>Genoua</hi> ſeated themſelves there, as alſo the <hi>Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers</hi> of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1510. and many other Nations were invited thither by the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Marriage Dowries, which became Shadows to many Frauds, for when Husbands either brake in their life-time, or be found
<hi>Bankrupt</hi> at death, the Wives are preferr'd to all Debtors in the Recovery of their Dowry. And thus far he ſheweth the Riſing and Falling of the <hi>Trade of Bruges,</hi> and how it came to be removed and ſettled in
<hi>Antwerp;</hi> and how ſince alſo it hath been loſt and departed thence, I have ſhewed in another place: and this is as<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98306:115"/>much as I have thought good to inſert of the <hi>Trade</hi> in general of <hi>Netherland,</hi> concluding, that though the Country be of ſmall extent, and be barren of rich Commodities either to preſerve or ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Merchants;</hi> and now at this day they traffick to all parts of the habitable World, with the Commodities of their own Countries, which by their Endeavours and Pains they make and purchaſe to be as if naturally and really the ſame were their own.</p>
                     <p>Now for the general <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſo far forth as it is in obedience to the <hi>Archduke,</hi> or more properly to the <hi>Kings of Spain,</hi> it muſt be granted, that it holds not any equality at this day with that part in ſubjection to the <hi>States. Antwerp</hi> as the principal City, of which the <hi>Flemings</hi> did, and might juſtly boaſt, is now, as then the chiefeſt; but the former Splendor is now and long ago loſt; for it had the Preheminence, and was one of the chief Cities of <hi>Traffick</hi> in the World, but is now only the chief of this Juriſdiction. What it could formerly herein challenge, it hath now loſt: For if the <hi>Trade</hi> thereof be well obſerved, it will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, it looks not ſo high by many Millions as it did then, the

<hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Which Rule found here, as in all
<hi>Spain</hi> for the moſt part true, and granted, it muſt be confeſſed their <hi>Trade</hi> cannot poſſbly be of any great conſequence: For ſuch is the nature of a <hi>free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled Commerce,</hi> that no Country or Nation how remote or diſtant ſoever, can give limit or bound thereto. Whereupon it may be inferred, and as by proof at this day it is found obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, their general <hi>Traffick</hi> is ſmall, and conſiſteth more by a laborious Induſtry of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The principal means whereby their ſmall <hi>Traffick</hi> is now maintained to them, is by their ſeveral ſorts of cunning and artificial
<hi>Fabricks</hi> and <hi>Manufactures,</hi> which every Town of any note is notable for, ſuch as are <hi>Hangings of Arras, Tapeſtry,</hi> ſome ſorts of <hi>Stuffs</hi> of <hi>Silk,</hi> and of <hi>Woollen</hi> and
<hi>Linnen;</hi> and in <hi>Exchanges</hi> to purchaſe which, the
<hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and other the neighbouring Nations bring them
<hi>Woollen Cloths,</hi> and <hi>Wines,</hi> and ſome other needful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſio is which they want to ſupply their Occaſions, and the Neceſſities of thoſe Armies as are for the moſt part ſeen to be ſed, maintained and clothed in this Country. <hi>Dunkirk</hi> their only and beſt Sea-Port, affords ſome Shipping, and ſo poorly ſet on work by way of <hi>merchandiſing,</hi> that they find their beſt <hi>Traffick</hi> to conſiſt of <hi>Thievery</hi> and <hi>Boothalling</hi> againſt both their Friends and their Enemies the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> which yet they are ſo far unable really to ſet out to any competency of ſtrength, that the
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other the devouter <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Friers,</hi> are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times induced to ſet their helping hand thereto, this way oftentimes ſpending in uncharitable Actions and Blood-ſhed the charitable Alms of the poor and deluded Multitude: and how well this <hi>Trade</hi> hath thriven with theſe <hi>irreligious Eccleſiaſtical Orders,</hi> their great Loſſes by their Reports ſufficiently witneſs to the World.</p>
                     <p>So leaving the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> to endeavour the regaining of their loſt <hi>Traffick,</hi> and the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk Free-booters</hi> and their <hi>holy Partners</hi> to the recovery of their late Damage by ſome more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Commerce,</hi> I will here leave <hi>Flanders,</hi> and hence travel further into this Continent, and ſurvey the particular

                        </note>THe particular <hi>Trading</hi> of ſeveral Cities being thus obſerved, it will not be amiſs a little to look into the
<hi>Trade in general</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and therewith alſo the Navigation of this Nation, by which we find, that in all Countries almoſt the ſame is principally maintained. The Cities then found on the Sea-coaſt on the North-ſide of <hi>Germany,</hi> have very great ſhips; yet more fit for great ſtowage and burthen, than either for ſail or defence; and therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to this end fraighted by the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> Neither can I attribute much commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>German Mariner,</hi> for thoſe Seas in good part, and the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea altogether, are found free of pirates and piracies, which is the chief reaſon why their Ships are found in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to be ſo ill armed, either defenſive or offenſive, and in one thing they concur with the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the ſhame of the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> profeſſion, that their is never found any
<hi>Prayers</hi> uſed aboard their Ships, neither morning or evening, contrary to the laudable cuſtom and godly exerciſe of our <hi>Engliſh Mariners,</hi> who conſtantly uſe <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> at leaſt four times in four and twenty hours, which is at the ſetting of the four quarterly <hi>watches</hi> of the day and night. Theſe Maritime Cities are for the moſt part either <hi>Hanſ-Towns</hi> or free Cities, becauſe they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed of old in all <hi>neighbour Kingdoms,</hi> great priveleges of buying any <hi>Commodities,</hi> as well of Strangers as Citizens, and of ſelling their own to either at pleaſure, and to bring in or carry out all
<hi>Commodities</hi> by their own Ships, with like immunities equal to Citizens in all the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and no leſs prejudicial to others, than advantageous to themſelves; and in <hi>London</hi> they were wont to dwell together in the houſe called the <hi>Still yard,</hi> and there enjoyed theſe and many other privileges, which now for many years have lain dead; partly by reaſon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> found not theſe or the like privileges in theſe free <hi>Hanſ-towns;</hi> and partly, by reaſon they have found it more commodious to make uſe of their own ſhipping, as in theſe days it is found they do.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, yet it is obſerved, that the
<hi>Germans</hi> in general apply themſelves very induſtriouſly to all
<hi>Traffick</hi> by land, but the <hi>free Cities</hi> on the Sea coaſts do but coldly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it by Sea; Beer being found to be ſpent and exported amongſt themſelves in an incredible meaſure and quantity, with an extraordinary gain, and therefore noted for one of the prime commodities of this <hi>Empire,</hi> bringing profit not only to private men, but alſo to
<hi>Princes</hi> and to <hi>free States,</hi> there being no
<hi>Merchandize</hi> in the World that more eaſily finds a buyer in
<hi>Germany,</hi> than this: for other <hi>Commodities,</hi> it is obſervable, that <hi>Germany</hi> ſends into <hi>Italy Linens, Corn</hi> and <hi>Wax;</hi> it ſends into <hi>England Bords, Iron, Diaper, Rheniſh Wines</hi> and <hi>Noremberg</hi> wares, which can hardly be called

<hi>England Lead, Tin,</hi> and <hi>woollen Cloths;</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> returns them <hi>Spaniſh Wines, Fruits, Oils, Salt,</hi> ſome
<hi>Woolls,</hi> and other commodities.</p>
                     <p>I formerly noted, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had their
<hi>Staple</hi> at <hi>Embden,</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> whereof uſed them well and courteouſly, but Wars growing between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> the place grew danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for them: for their Goods were taken, and themſelves made Priſoners, even in the mouth of the Harbour; whereupon they removed to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> where being oppreſſed with <hi>new impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and being denied the exerciſe of their Religion, they removed alſo thence, and ſetled their <hi>Staple</hi> at
<hi>Stoad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then alſo our <hi>Engliſh</hi> had their <hi>Staple</hi> at <hi>Dantzick</hi> in <hi>Pruſen,</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> but when the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> under pretence of the <hi>Suevian war,</hi> exacted of them a <hi>Dollar</hi> for each woollen-cloth, and as much proportionably upon all other commodities; and afterwards, though the war being ended, yet would remit nothing of the ſame; and withal, forbad the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> by a law decreed, to live in <hi>Poland,</hi> the
<hi>commodities</hi> whereof were only ſold there, leſt they ſhould learn the language, and find out the myſtery of that <hi>trade</hi> and
<hi>Country:</hi> And laſtly, when as they exacted as much weekly of an
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> dwelling in their City, as they did of a <hi>Jew</hi> dwelling there amongſt them, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thereupon made agreement with the Senate of <hi>Melvin</hi> for a 11 years, to pay them ſix
<hi>groſs</hi> for each cloth brought in, and accordingly for all other goods, and to pay as much more in the City of <hi>Kettle</hi> to the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Pruſen,</hi> for his giving them free paſſage to
<hi>Melvin;</hi> and ſo by this means they ſetled their <hi>Staple</hi> in
<hi>Melvin:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> being offended with the Citizens of <hi>Melvin,</hi> and the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> no leſs with thoſe of <hi>Stoad,</hi> procured all the <hi>free Cities</hi> by a publick writing to out law not only <hi>Melvin</hi> and <hi>Stoad</hi> for receiving the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to the common prejudice of the reſt, but alſo
<hi>Ceningsberg,</hi> the ſeat of the Duke of <hi>Pruſen,</hi> and the free City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> for favouring the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this their courſe, and for permitting them being ſtrangers, to ſell their goods to any other than the Citizens of each ſeveral City. But how theſe difference; came<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98306:123"/>afterward to be reconciled, and their
<hi>Staples</hi> removed thence, I have ſhewed in other places.</p>

                        </note>THE excellent Commodity of the great Rivers that in all places of this large <hi>Empire</hi> are found to water and enrich this Country, ſhould much incite this Nation to the <hi>Trade</hi> of
<hi>Merchandize;</hi> but it is often found, that where Nature is moſt liberal in her Furtherances, the Inhabitants prove moſt backward in their Endeavours; the natural Coldneſs of the Climate incloſing the People into their warm <hi>Stoves,</hi> and the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Tartars</hi> (who in ſome reſpect reſembling Dogs, neither ſuffering the
<hi>Moſcovites</hi> to traffick, nor yet traffick themſelves) by their continual harrying of the Country, and the often Incurſions and Wars of the
<hi>Swedes,</hi> may in ſome ſort ſerve them for a reaſonable Excuſe; yet it is ſound, that theſe Wars prove main Helps ſometimes to their Traffick, eſpecially in <hi>Furs,</hi> for their Bodies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inured to Cold and Hardneſs, make the Paſtime of <hi>Hunting</hi> a profitable Exerciſe in the worſt Seaſon of the year, the reſt of their
<hi>Merchandize</hi> come to them very near in the ſame kind: for it wholly depends upon <hi>Manufactures</hi> and Labour for <hi>Cordage; Linens</hi> and
<hi>Yarn</hi> they have from the Earth, as their <hi>Hides, Tallow</hi> and
<hi>Wax</hi> upon the ſame; the <hi>Caveare</hi> and <hi>Train Oyl,</hi> and ſome other ſuch by <hi>Fiſhing:</hi> ſo that it may be ſuppoſed they are more addicted to <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing</hi> than to
<hi>Merchandiſing.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> about the year 1575 firſt diſcovered the <hi>Trade,</hi> and found here good Entertainment and great Privileges from the then reigning Prince, and the firſt Diſcoverers were in
<hi>London</hi> incorporated into a <hi>Society of Merchants,</hi> by the name of the <hi>Moſcovia Company,</hi> by Grant of <hi>Queen Elizabeth;</hi> which Company hath been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſome Alterations and Contingencies of their

The Revenues both of the King and Gentlemen is here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed but moderate, and ſcarce ſufficient to maintain a plentiful Table, and to exchange with Merchants for Wines and Spices, which they yet much covet, as alſo they do forein Stuffs of Silks<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98306:130"/>and Cloth: I have noted, that this Kingdom aboundeth with Beaſts as well wild as tame, and yieldeth excellent Horſes, not great but quick, nimble and ſtirring; it aboundeth alſo in Fleſh, Fowl, and Water-Fiſh, and in all kind of Pulſe and Grain; it is found alſo towards the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains of <hi>Hungary</hi> to have ſome Mines of Gold and Silver, of Iron and Brimſtone; it yieldeth alſo in abundance plenty of Honey found in hollow Trees, beſides the Husband-man's Hives: it yieldeth moreover, Wax, Flax, and Linen Cloths made thereof, Hemp, <hi>Pitch</hi> of both kinds, Maſts for Ships, Boards and Timber, rich Furs, Salt digged out of the Earth, Amber, Soap-aſhes, and Rice in abundance, which hath made <hi>Dantzick</hi> famous throughout

<hi>Pruſſia</hi> with their immunities ſubject to this Kingdom, is ſound to have the principal Traders therein inhabiting, yet have they but few Ships, uſing Strangers to export their Commodities. For the reſt of the
<hi>Polanders</hi> they are obſerved to live content with their own, and not by way of Merchandizing to ſtir much abroad; yet are they not rich, becauſe they want the aboveſaid Commodities, which the proud Gentlemen and Nobility of theſe Countries buy dear, and will have, though brought from far unto them, and they are noted to have ſo little Gold and Silver, as deſpiſing all in reſpect of it; they ſell the rich Commodities of their Country at a low rate, eſpecially thoſe which are for daily Food, and thereby made unfit to be exported. The People themſelves are not much addicted to Traffick into remote Regions, nor to travel far out of their own Countries; yet in imitation of other their Neighbours, they ſometimes Trade with their rich Furs into other Countries, of whom I have obſerved ſome to come to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> rather making a ranging Voyage, than coming with intent to Trade and Reſide. Wherein they cannot be much blamed, in regard that they have in plenty all things that naturally are wanting to mankind, if they can be contented therewith: but the Inhabitants of <hi>Pomerland, Eaſt Country,</hi> &amp;c. are obſerved to be more ingenious, and far more addict to Traffick and Commerce, and have ſome Veſſels ſitter for tranſport and carriage than for warfare, but yet moſt proper for their groſs Commodities and large Stowage, however their Winter-colds depriving them of almoſt half the years Traffick: the other half wherein their Seas are navigable, cannot make them any competent amends, and their Merchandize being altogether groſs, cannot give them therefore the attribute of Eminent Merchants.</p>

<hi>Sovereign's Value for Value,</hi> is grounded upon the weight, fineneſs and valuation of the Moneys of each ſeveral Kingdom, City, or Place; the ſeveral Standards thereof ſo equally, proportioned, ſo truly and juſtly by the Art of the Mint rectified, that each Prince his Coin in Exchanges may have its due allowance, according to the goodneſs and fineneſs, coarſneſs and badneſs thereof: and therefore herein to make and to ſettle this above-named <hi>Par</hi> exactly betwixt one Kingdom and another, we are to examine and compare, not only the weight and fineneſs of our own Coins as they are in themſelves, but alſo the weight and fineneſs of thoſe of other Princes and Countries, with the real proportion that happeneth therein, not only between our own Gold and Silver, but alſo between the Gold and Silver of other Countries. This examination, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon and proportion, duly, rightly and really examined, compared and proportioned, and no difference, inequality or diſproportion, found or admitted therein, then may our Exchanges run at one and the ſame Price and Rate both for Gold and Silver, taking the denomination accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the valuation of the Money of each Country and Kingdom, hereby finding how much fine Silver or Gold our own Pound ſterling containeth, and what quantity of other Moneys, either of
<hi>France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Eaſtland,</hi> &amp;c. this Kingdom is to have in Exchange, to countervail the ſame in the weight and fineneſs, anſwerable to our own, be it by the Pound, Dollar, Ducat, Crown, or any other real or imaginary Coin, giving always a Value for Value, and receiving the like; which, by reaſon of the great Conſequence depending thereon, I here call the <hi>Prince</hi> his <hi>Par,</hi> in the Exchanges of his Moneys by Bills of Exchange with other Countries and Kingdoms.</p>

For Example:</p>

                     <p>Firſt it is to be noted, That if by the Rules above mentioned, the Profits of the ſaid Sum at 2½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> for one payment comes to <hi>l.</hi> 39. 0. 4 <hi>d.</hi> that Sum is to be added to the Principal, and then it doth amount unto <hi>l.</hi> 1599. 15 <hi>s.</hi>
4 <hi>d.</hi> out of which muſt be drawn the Exchange of the ſecond payment, and add that likewiſe to the principal, and out of that the Exchange of the third, and adding that in the ſame manner, and it giveth 1680.

<hi>Baiocs</hi> 97, of <hi>Julio's</hi> 10 <hi>per Crown,</hi> which he deſires to reduce into <hi>Crowns</hi> of the <hi>Fſtampe,</hi> or as ſome Term them <hi>de Camera,</hi> thereby to make them fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into any other place, the <hi>Aggio</hi> of the Moneys being conſidered, as commonly is ſeen at 45 <hi>Julio's;</hi> I demand then how many
<hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Eſtampe</hi> the ſame will produce? To know which, you muſt firſt ſee how much the 100 <hi>Deſtampe</hi> are worth in
<hi>Julio's</hi> at <hi>Julio's</hi> 12 the <hi>Crown,</hi> which will be
<hi>Julio's</hi> 1200, to which muſt be added 45 <hi>Julio's</hi> for the
<hi>Aggio</hi> thereof, becauſe that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Eſtampe</hi> is worth 12 <hi>Julio's,</hi> and then the <hi>Aggio,</hi> which comes to be 12
<hi>Julio's</hi> and <hi>Baiocs</hi> 4½ <hi>per Crown,</hi> or elſe 45
<hi>Julio's</hi> for <hi>Crowns</hi> 100, and they will be 1245
<hi>Julio's,</hi> and ſo much ſhall 100 <hi>Crowns Deſtampe</hi> be worth the <hi>Aggio</hi> of the Money compriſed; likewiſe in the ſame manner you muſt reduce the ſaid Sum of <hi>Crowns of money</hi> into
<hi>Julio's,</hi> and they make <hi>Julio's</hi> 34419 and <hi>Baiocs</hi> 7, comprehending 9 <hi>Julio's</hi> and 7 <hi>Baiocs,</hi> for 97 <hi>Baiocs,</hi> and this being done, then work by the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> and ſay, If
<hi>Julio's</hi> 1245 give <hi>Crowns of Gold</hi> of <hi>Eſtampe</hi> 100
<hi>Crowns,</hi> how much ſhall the ſaid <hi>Julio's</hi> 34419. 7 give? Then to multiply the ſaid <hi>Julio's</hi> by 100, there is only a Cypher to be added after the 7 <hi>Baiocs,</hi> and proſecuting thus the working of the queſtion, it will amount unto <hi>Crowns</hi> 2764. 12. 8. of
<hi>Eſtamp.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Proof of the <hi>Aggios</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note>Now to prove the ſaid account, you muſt multiply the ſaid

                     <p>Another Example of a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> given to enlighten this point, I will add hereunto.</p>
                     <p>There is <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi> given at

<hi>Crowns</hi> 74⅓, and money for <hi>Florence</hi> at <hi>Crowns</hi>
94⅔, the queſtion is then; If at theſe prices the ſaid
<hi>Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> may be effected? The which to accompliſh and know, I muſt ſay by the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Rome</hi> giveth the <hi>uncertain</hi> to both thoſe ſaid places, If <hi>Crowns</hi> 73⅔ give 93⅓ <hi>Crowns,</hi> what will
<hi>Crowns</hi> 74⅓ give? And it will give by the ſaid Rule,

<hi>Exchangers</hi> do abreviate their labour, and ſhorten their task therein, and the rather I have preſumed to add the ſame here, and in this place, partly in regard that I have not found it publiſhed by any of our
<hi>Engliſh Arithmeticians,</hi> but princinally to ſhew the learner the ways how the ſame are there wrought and <hi>Arithmetically</hi> calculated.</p>
                     <p>It is generally confeſt by all <hi>Arithmeticians,</hi> that the whole Art of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> depends upon five principal Rules, now commonly in all Countreys received and taught, that is, by <hi>Numerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Addition, Subſtraction, Multiplication,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and that no one propoſed queſtion in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick</hi> can be perfected without the help of ſome of theſe; for the three former, I find not any diſagreement in the common received manner by them and us, and therefore I will omit to ſpeak any thing thereof; but of the two latter, whereby is obſerved that moſt Rules and Queſtions of all <hi>Exchanges</hi> are perfected and performed, I will here inſiſt upon, induced prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as I ſaid before, to enlighten thereby the precedent Examples that I have handled in the calculations of the <hi>Exchanges</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I will then in the firſt place, contrary to the cuſtom of our <hi>Engliſh Maſters in this Science,</hi> begin with that part of
<hi>Arithmetick</hi> which we call <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and by an example or two of the working thereof, explain the ſame to ſuch as either ſhall be deſirous to learn it, or ſuch as ſhall deſire to make uſe of the before-mention'd <hi>Tables.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">Diviſion abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of Accounts.</note>A certain <hi>Merchant</hi> then bought 46 Cloths, which coſt him 673 <hi>l.</hi> and deſireth by a brief way to know what one Cloth doth ſtand him in; To do which, I diſpoſe of the queſtion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> and ſay, If 46 Clothes coſt 673 <hi>l.</hi> how much doth one Cloth coſt?</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as it would prove to be too diſſicult, at firſt ſight after the common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to find how often 46 the
<hi>Diviſor</hi> is found in 673, it will be more facile and commodious, to take it after their method thus, Take then the firſt <hi>figure,</hi> which is 4, and ſee how often the ſame is included in the figure 6, which is once, the which 1 I write then under the <hi>Diviſor,</hi> drawing a line between them, and then multiply it by the whole <hi>Diviſor</hi> 46, beginning at 6, ſaying once 6 is 6, and next coming to the ſum that is to be divided 673, I chuſe the ſecond <hi>figure</hi> 7, from whence I take 6 and there remains one, which I place under the ſaid 7, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to the <hi>Diviſor,</hi> I multiply 1 by 4, which giveth 4, which I
<hi>deduct</hi> from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>figure</hi> 6, of the ſum to be
<hi>divided,</hi> and there remains 2, the which I write under the 6; ſo that
46 taken by this means out of 67, there remains 21, from whence I proceed and put this before the <hi>figure</hi> 3 remaining, which thereby makes 213, for the ſum that now remains to be divided by 46, ſaying in 21, how many times
4? which cannot be but 4 times, for in taking 5 there will remain but 1, which with the following <hi>figure</hi> doth make 13, (the which number cannot pay 5 times 6, and for this cauſe I can take but 4,) multiplying the
<hi>Diviſor</hi> as at firſt, ſaying (beginning always by the laſt figure of the <hi>Diviſor</hi>) 4 times 6 is 24, and taking the laſt
<hi>figure</hi> 3 from the ſum to be divided 213, the which for payment, of
24 I borrow 3 tens, which I bear in mind, and ſay 24 from 33 there reſts 9, the which I place under the 3, and then come to <hi>multiply</hi> the other
<hi>figure</hi> 4 of the <hi>diviſor</hi> by 4, and it makes 16, which with 3 tens born in mind, makes 19, which muſt be <hi>deducted</hi> from the ſum to be <hi>divided</hi> 21, ſo there will reſt 2, the which I place under the 1; as by the Example appeareth more at large.</p>
                     <p>So that 673 <hi>l. divided</hi> by 46 <hi>Cloths,</hi> the
<hi>quotient</hi> giveth 14 <hi>l.</hi> and the reſt is 29 <hi>l.</hi> which now is to be <hi>divided</hi> by 46, which cannot be done, and therefore the ſame to be reduced to <hi>ſhillings,</hi> which multiplied by 20 come to
580 <hi>s.</hi> which muſt now be <hi>divided</hi> by 46, in the manner before ſhewed, ſaying, how many times 4 in 5? which is once, the which I write in the <hi>quotient</hi> at the ſide of 14 <hi>l.</hi> proceeding from the firſt <hi>diviſion, multiplying</hi> it by 6, and it giveth 6, which taken from 8 the reſt is 2, which I put under the 8, and <hi>multiply</hi> the other <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>diviſor</hi> 4 by 1, which giveth 4 taken from 5, there reſts 1, then 46 <hi>ſubſtracted</hi> from 58 there reſts 12, right with which I put the other <hi>figure</hi> 0, reſting of the ſum to be divided, and return to ſay, how many times 6 in 12, the which I can take but 2, and I place it in the <hi>quotient,</hi> and
<hi>multiply</hi> it by the laſt <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>diviſor,</hi> ſaying 2 times 6 is 12, which I <hi>deduct</hi> from 120, the which to do, I ſay (borrowing 2 tens, which I bear in mind) 12 from 20 reſts 8, which I place under the 0, and <hi>multiply</hi> the other <hi>figure</hi> of the
<hi>Diviſor</hi> 4 by, making 8 with the 2 born in mind, comes
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:98306:214"/>to be 10, taken from 12 there reſts 2, ſo that 580
<hi>s.</hi> divided by 46, the <hi>product</hi> is 12 <hi>s.</hi> and there remaineth yet 28 <hi>s.</hi> which muſt be brought into <hi>pence, multiplied</hi> by 12, and it makes 336, the which muſt be <hi>divided</hi> by 46, ſaying in 33, how many times 4? which is 7 times, the which I place in the <hi>quotient</hi> by the <hi>ſhillings, multiplying</hi> 7 by 6, which makes 42 from 46, there reſts 4, the which I place under the 6, and keep 4 in mind borrowed, <hi>adding</hi> them with 4 times 7, they make 32, which

                  <head>To the READER.</head>
                  <p>I Formerly publiſhed a ſmall Treatiſe concerning <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which having found good Acceptance by all into whoſe hands it came, (that ever I could hear of,) and being ſince much ſolicited by ſome to inlarge upon that Theme, that I might be ſerviceable in my generation, and for the more general Good of all, I have yielded to their Deſires; for whereas I did in the firſt Impreſſion mention only ſome
<hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of Merchants concerning: <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> I have now in this ſecond not only compriſed what was formerly handled, and ſomething enlarged upon the ſame, for the better underſtanding thereof, but alſo added very much in ſetting down the Nature of Exchange, the ſeveral Denominations and kinds thereof, the Pair of ſome Countries, the proper Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations and Names of thoſe Perſons which do negotiate Exchange, how many Perſons which do negotiate by Exchange, how many Perſons are therein active, divers Caſes propounded and reſolved, Objections anſwered, to know when any Bill will fall due, Monies taken up by Letters of Credit, two perfect Tables of the juſt day from New ſtile to Old ſtile throughout the Year, which may ſerve as an indifferent Judg between Party and Party, and full Directions almoſt in all Caſes that may happen in <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> uſeful as well to the Merchant-man, as to the Notary, and others, for I have in a manner gone through the whole Body of Exchange. As for Attachments, and ſome few other Caſes on Bills of Exchange, I have purpoſely omitted, leſt I ſhould give occaſion to any tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Spirit to make Conteſt where none need. The right dealing Merchant doth not care how little he hath to do in the Common Law, or things of that nature; neither have I herein ſet down ſeveral Inſtances of Exchanges of one Town or Country with another, to ſhew what the Parcel will amount to with the Exchange from one ſort of Mony or Species to another, in regard the ſame hath been already publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Lewis Roberts,</hi> in his <hi>Map of Commerce;</hi> but I have given my Advice in the Practical part of Exchanges, according to the Cuſtom of Merchants uſed in <hi>England.</hi> And I have generally back'd my Advice with ſome Reaſons, which amongſt Wiſe Men is eſteemed more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than Law it ſelf. I dare warrant the proceedings of any that ſhall walk after this my Advice to be good and juſtifiable by the Law of Merchants; but I think I need not hang out a Buſh, if the Palat be right I know the Wine cannot be diſreliſhed: It is the Crop of four and twenty Years Experience in my Employment in the Art of a Notary Publick. Reader, let not one Peruſal ſuffice thee, this Labour is mine, the Gain will be thine, I am but the Adviſer, be thou Adviſed by</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>EXCHANGE</hi> is by ſome held to be the moſt myſterious part of the Art of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> and <hi>Traffick,</hi> being grounded upon Cuſtom and Experience; and the Neceſſity and Commodiouſneſs of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes</hi> is ſeen, in that it hath found a general Allowance in all Countries time out of mind, and yet is maintained with the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, for it prevents the Danger and Adventure of Carriage of Moneys from one City or Country to another.</p>
                     <p>And this is done only by two or three Lines written on a ſmall piece of Paper, termed, <hi>A Bill of Exchange;</hi> which is ſo noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, that tho it cannot properly, (as I conceive) be called a
<hi>Specialty,</hi> becauſe it wanteth thoſe Formalities which by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law of <hi>England</hi> are thereunto required, as Seal, Delivery and Witneſſes; yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent thereunto, if not beyond, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any Specialty or Bond, in its pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuality and preciſe Payment, carrying with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98306:226"/>it a commanding Power, tho directed from the Servant to the Maſter; for if by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, it concerneth him every whit as much to ſee it be paid with Honour at the time, as the Servant can deſire, or the Party to whom it is payable can expect, in regard the Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptor's Credit lieth at ſtake: And if he fail of Payment at the preciſe day, preſently there will iſſue forth a <hi>Proteſt,</hi> which may tell tales, and ſoon make a Dilemma in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; for he muſt not expect to continue his Credit long, that doth not pay his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bills at the time appointed, and beſides his own, his Servant or Friend, the Drawer's Credit will alſo be wounded; beſides the Charges which are incident thereunto, and unavoidable Payment of Principal and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at the end, if the Party or Parties are able; for both Acceptor and Drawer are bound till Payment, as ſhall be more particularly ſhew'd in this enſuing Treatiſe. Thus much in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for I love not to ſpend more words than need, or tell a large Story to little or no purpoſe.</p>

                     <head>Exchange what it is.</head>
                     <p>REal <hi>Exchange</hi> is nothing elſe, but to give or take up Mony in one City or Town, to the End to have it again, or to reſtore the juſt Value thereof in Mony in another Town, according to the Price which ſhall be agreed upon between the Taker and the Deliverer, to allow or pay for the Exchange of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Loſs of Time, which will be from the time that the Mony is taken up or delivered, till it be reſtored or received again.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Inland and Outland Bills all alike.</head>
                     <p>AND by this it appeareth, That a Bill of Exchange which ſhall be made for Monies taken up at <hi>Edenborough, York, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, Exon, Plimouth, Dover,</hi> or any other part of <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and payable at <hi>London,</hi> is in all things as effectual as any <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> made beyond the Seas, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here in <hi>England,</hi> which we uſe to call an <hi>Outland Bill,</hi> and the other an <hi>Inland Bill,</hi> both the Inland and Outland being made for Monies taken up by Exchange: and Exchange of Monies being a thing which may be done as well from one Town to another, as from one Country, Kingdom or Nation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it muſt needs be, that the Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change which ſhall be made as well at one part as at another, (I mean Inland and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) ought to be eſteemed of equal Worth, and the Cuſtom of Merchants on both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually obſerved; howbeit Mr. <hi>John Trenchant</hi> in his Book of Arithmetick printed at <hi>Lions Anno</hi> 1608. ſaith, that an Exchange made in the ſame Realm, as from <hi>Lions</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> is not real, for that the real Exchange is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only for Exchange between Towns in ſubjection to divers Lords, who do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Monies to be tranſported out of their own Territories, or becauſe the Monies are not conveyed from one place to another without great Loſs.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Four Perſons to make an Exchange, and how called.</head>
                     <p>ORdinarily there are four Perſons requiſite to be imployed in taking up or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Parcel of Money by Exchange, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Broker who doth procure the Parcel) as namely, two at the Place where the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is taken up, and two at the Place where the Mony is payable. 1. The Party who delivers the Mony by Exchange, whom we uſe to call the Deliverer, or the Giver, (and the <hi>French, le Banquier,</hi>) becauſe there are who keep a Stock of Mony only to negotiate by Exchange (as our Uſurers do Mony to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver at Intereſt) altho theſe Bankers will as well take up as deliver Monies by Exchange, according as they ſee it moſt advantagious to them, by the Riſe or Fall of the Price of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Exchange. 2. The Taker or Party who receives or takes up Mony by Exchange, and this Party we uſually call the Drawer, becauſe he may be ſaid to be the chief occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Draught of thoſe Monies from one place to another by virtue of his <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi> 3. The Party who is to pay the Mony, or he upon whom the Bill is drawn, or to whom the <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> is directed. And 4. The Party to whom the Mony is made payable, or he to whom the Bill is ſent to get accepted, and to receive the Mony when due according to the Bill. So that by ſetting down theſe four Parties, and what uſe there is of them in Exchange of Monies, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that there muſt be a Correſpondency and familiar Acquaintance between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who delivers Monies by Exchange, and he to whom the ſame is made payable; and the Party who takes up Monies by Exchange, and he on whom the Bill is drawn.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Three Perſons to make an Exchange.</head>
                     <p>BUT ſometimes there are but three Perſons needful in the doing a parcel of Mony by Exchange; as Firſt the Taker; Secondly, the Deliverer; and Thirdly, the Party upon whom the Bill is drawn. 1. The Taker, he makes and ſubſcribes a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> for ſo much Mony by him received of the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer. 2. The Deliverer, he orders the Bill to be made payable to himſelf, or Aſſigns for the value of himſelf. And 3. The Party that is to pay the Bill; for the Taker directs the Bill to his Friend or Servant to pay the ſame. Now, this way of Exchange is very uſeful,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98306:226"/>according as occaſion may be. For ſuppoſe I were to go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> there to employ ſome Monies in the buying of ſome Coromodity; I deliver my Monies here in <hi>London,</hi> to ſome body who gives me his <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> on his Friend, Factor or Servant at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> payable to my ſelf; ſo I carry the Bill along with me, and receive my Mony my ſelf by virtue thereof at
<hi>Plimouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another way, wherein only three Perſons are needful in the Negotiation of Monies by Exchange: namely, Firſt, the Drawer; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Party on whom it is drawn. Thirdly, the Party to whom it is payable. 1. The Drawer having Monies in his hands belonging to the Party to whom he orders the Bill to be paid, doth make a <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> himſelf, confeſſing the value received in his own hand. 2. Charging it on his Friend or Factor. 3. Payable to the Party to whom he was indebted. There is yet one way more wherein Monies may be remitted by Exchange only with the help of three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; 1. The Taker. 2. The Deliverer. 3. The Party to whom payable. As thus, If I were at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> or <hi>Exon,</hi> and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to <hi>London,</hi> I would take up Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Exchange at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> or <hi>Exon,</hi> and ſubſcribe <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> for the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Value received of the Deliverer, directed or drawn on my ſelf, payable to whom the Deliverer ſhould appoint in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Two Perſons to make an Exchange.</head>
                     <p>LIkewiſe a Parcel of Money may be done by Exchange between two Perſons: Firſt, the Drawer; and ſecondly, the Party on whom it is drawn; the Drawer he makes a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> payable to himſelf or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the Value in himſelf, and ſubſcribes the Bill, and directs it to the Party that owes him Money, and is to pay it by Exchange; by which Bill (when the Party on whom it is drawn hath accepted it) he becometh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btor to the Drawer, and he, before the Bill falls due, doth negotiate the Parcel with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, and ſo draws in the Money at the place where he liveth, and makes only an Aſſignment on the Bill, payable to him of whom he hath received the Value. The Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of framing <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> after theſe ſeveral Forms before-mentioned, will be found out according as each Man's Occaſion ſhall preſent in his Trade and Commerce by Exchange, which is ſo neceſſary, that there is fearce a Merchant but at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one way or other, doth either receive or pay Monies by <hi>Bills of Exchange.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe manner of Exchanges before-mentioned are termed
<hi>Real Exchange,</hi> becauſe it is a thing really done, and the Mony real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exchanged from one place to another.</p>
                     <p>There are other Exchanges of Monies, ſo called (but improperly) as <hi>Dry Exchange, Feigned</hi> or <hi>Imaginary Exchange, Small</hi> or <hi>Petty Exchange.</hi>

                        <hi>FEigned Exchange,</hi> is, when I ow a Banker Monies, and have none at preſent to pay; I deſire time, the Banker grants it me; but I am to pay him his Mony by Exchange at the time at <hi>Rouen,</hi> yet we are agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our ſelves, that if I pay it him here in <hi>London</hi> at the time, then I am free, otherwiſe I am bound as above. In the interim, the Banker writes to his Friend at <hi>Rouen,</hi> that againſt ſuch a time he ſend him from thence a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> for the like Sum; feigning that he oweth it him there. After the time is expired, comes a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> from <hi>Rouen,</hi> to pay here ſo much as he owed there, with the Rechange; all which the Banker puts to my Accompt, and <hi>per</hi> our Agreement will force me to pay, in caſe I do not pay him here at the time agreed upon.</p>

                     <p>IF a man would take up mony by Exchange, and he be not well known to the Party that is to deliver the Mony; or if the man that world take up the Mony by Exchange be not eſteemed of ſufficient Credit for the ſame with the Deliverer; and thereupon if the Deliverer of the Mony ſhall deſire another man to be bound with the Taker for the Mony that is to be delivered by Exchange, and to be his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and engage himſelf for the Mony delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; this may be done two manner of ways: For firſt, either the Party who is the principal Taker, may make three Bills of Exchange, firſt, ſecond, and third, all of one tenor and date, for the Mony he is to take up, in the uſual manner, payable to the Party who is the Deliverer of the Mony, or to his order, for the value received of himſelf; and the Party who is to be bound as Surety, may only ſubſcribe the third Bill of Exchange with the principal Taker or Drawer, which third Bill the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer may keep by him for his ſecurity: Or elſe ſecondly, only two Bills of Exchange (firſt and ſecond) may be made and ſubſcribed by the principal who takes up the Mony, payable to him who is to be the Surety, or his order, for the value of himſelf, and then the Surety muſt make an Aſſignment upon both Bills of Exchange, and make them payable to the party who really and indeed doth deliver the value to the principal Taker, or to whom the ſame Deliverer of the Mony ſhall appoint, the Surety in the Aſſignment confeſſing the value received of the true and real Deliverer of the Mony; and in either of theſe ways, eſpecially in the former of them, the principal is wont to give Bond to the Surety (if he deſire it) to ſave him harmleſs, according to reaſon: And both of theſe ways are good and Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, though acted variouſly; for by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way the Deliverer of the Mony hath two Men equally bound unto him (by the third Bill) of whom they do confeſs to have received the value, and he that is properly but the Surety hath not the principal taker or Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Mony bound unto him in or by thoſe Bills of Exchange, but only by his Bond which he doth make thereupon; but by the latter way, only the Surety is bound to the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Mony by the Aſſignments which are to be made upon the Bills of Exchange; and the principal Drawer is bound to the Surety by the Bills of Exchange which only the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal doth ſubſcribe, and wherein he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the value received of the Surety, as is before expreſſed; and in this latter way, if in caſe the Bill be not accepted, and paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor thereof, then the true Deliverer of the Monies comes upon the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by virtue of his Aſſignment, for repayment, and the Surety comes upon the Principal by virtue of the Bill of Exchange by him ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as above. I ſhall not preſcribe either of theſe ways unto any, but ſhall leave it in the choiſe of every Merchant to follow which of theſe two ways he liketh beſt, and may ſute moſt to his occaſions.</p>

                     <p>IT happeneth often in Foreign Bills of Exchange, that they come payable either to the ſame Party that did deliver the value, or to his order; or elſe to ſome other body living beyond the Seas, who uſually doth ſend the firſt Bill of Exchange to ſome Friend of his here in
<hi>London,</hi> only to get accepted, and then to return it him again, that ſo, being accepted, he may the better negotiate the ſame Bill of Exchange again, and take in the value thereof, and make an Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſame, either on the accepted Bill, or on the other Bill of the ſame tenor, not accepted, according as occaſion ſhall be: Now, if an Aſſignment do come on the ſecond Bill, payable to another perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order where to take up the firſt accepted Bill; this ſecond Bill being preſented to the Party on whom it is drawn, to be accepted, he doth deny acceptance thereof, alledging that he hath already accepted the firſt Bill, but he doth not know to whom, or in whoſe hands the ſame firſt accepted Bill doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and thereupon the Party which hath the ſecond Bill, wanting acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth cauſe Proteſt to be made for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance; for prevention whereof, and that each party may receive all due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as is fitting, I would adviſe all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that have ſuch Bills of Exchange preſented unto them to be accepted, to note down in their Books the name of the party by whom the ſaid Bill is preſented unto them to be accepted, and his place of abode, that ſo, if in caſe the ſecond Bill be alſo preſented unto them by another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be accepted, the party on whom it is drawn, and who hath already accepted the firſt Bill, may give anſwer to him who ſhall preſent the ſecond Bill to be accepted, and acquaint him to whom he hath already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and acquaint him to whom he hath already accepted the firſt Bill, and where he liveth, that ſo the ſame may appear to be real, and remove ſcruples or doubts, which otherwiſe may ariſe therein; this I conceive is not yet generally practiſed and obſerved by all Merchants trading in Exchange, becauſe not commonly known, but it is Merchant-like, and I have ſeen it practiſed by ſome Merchants here in <hi>London,</hi> and I perſwade my ſelf it will be willingly embraced by all thoſe that mean honeſtly and endeavour after plain dealing, which cannot but redound to their credit.</p>

                     <p>AS it is commendable (and for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of doubts, which otherwiſe may be occaſioned) for the party on whom any Bill is drawn, to take notice where the party liveth that preſents him the Bill to be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which may be eaſily done, as I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſhewed; ſo on the other ſide, when ſuch Bills of Exchange are ſent unto any one to get accepted, I adviſe the party to whom they are ſent, upon receipt of his Letter, with the Bills of Exchange, preſently to take a Copy of the Bills,
<hi>verbatim,</hi> in a Book, which he may keep purpoſely for ſuch occaſions, eſpecially to write down the Names of the ſeveral Parties on whom they are drawn, or to whom they are directed, before ever he go about to get them accepted; I confeſs it is a little pains, and may ſeem at firſt hearing uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but if maturely conſidered, the benefit will countervail the labour; for by keeping Copies of all Bills of Exchange that do come to my hands, I can always ſee who are uſual Drawers and Deliverers of Mony by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, in thoſe places from whence the Bills do come; and if the Bills come from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> I can know how the Exchange went then at thoſe places; but eſpecially, if the Bills are ſent me only to get accepted, and then to return them, this Copying of the Bills of Exchange, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in a Book, before you ſend or deliver them out to the ſeveral Parties to whom they are directed to be accepted, is very uſeful, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member where, and to whom you are to call for your Bills again, and to ſee what Bills you want, which you have delivered out to be accepted, for otherwiſe you may chance to forget (when the Bills are out of your hands) to whom they were delivered to be accepted, and ſo be put to a non-plus, when you are to return your Friend an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and to give him an account of all thoſe Bills which he ſent you to get accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially if you have many Bills ſent you at one time: It happened once (as I have heard) that a Merchant had 7 or 8 Bills of Exchange at one time ſent him to get accepted, and he accordingly did deliver them out to the ſeveral parties on whom they were drawn, to be accepted, but when he was to write his Friend an anſwer, and return the Bills which were ſent unto him, he did miſs one of them, and could not in a good while remember with whom he left it, or to whom it was ſent to be accepted, becauſe he had not kept any particular notice thereof, which put him to ſome trouble to recollect himſelf, and to ſtudy where he had been, and with whom he had ſpoken, and what he had done from time to time, from<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98306:229"/>the time he received the Letter with the Bills of Exchange until that inſtant, and at length he did call to mind the name of the Party on whom the miſſing Bill was drawn, and ſo ſent to him, and had the Bill of Exchange accepted; but before he could remember the party, he was in much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, whereas if he had kept Copies of the Bills, or a breviate or Note of the places, dates, ſums, times of payment, drawer, and party to whom directed, ſuch perplexity of mind might have been prevented.</p>

                     <head>Whether a man is bound to preſent his Bill to be Accepted.</head>
                     <p>THere are ſome which hold an Opinion, that a man having a Bill made payable unto him, is not bound to get it accepted, or to Proteſt for non-acceptance, but that he may keep the Bill by him, and never preſent it to the Party on whom it is drawn, until the Bill be due; and that it reſts at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as arbitrator, whether he pleaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get acceptance of the Bill ſo ſoon as it comes to his hands or not: To this I ſay, That according to the cuſtom of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here in <hi>England,</hi> if I have a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſent unto me, I ought forthwith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receipt thereof, or ſo ſoon as convem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently I can, to preſent the ſame to the Party on whom it is drawn, or leave notice thereof at his dwelling-houſe or place of abode, and demand acceptance of the Bill, to pay at the time therein limited, that ſo the Party on whom it is drawn may take notice thereof, and order his buſineſs accordingly: True, will they ſay, if a Bill be ſent to me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Mony for another mans Account, and I to whom the Bill is ſent, am but as a Factor or Agent for the Party who delivered the value, then indeed I am to uſe my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to get the Bill accepted, and to give him advice thereof with the firſt, becauſe I am but as a Servant for another man, and reaſon teacheth that I muſt follow his order, and uſe all lawful endeavours for his ſecurity; but what if the Monies which are delivered by Exchange are my own Monies, and the Deliverer be my Factor or Servant, and the Bill be payable to me? In this caſe, may not I chuſe whether I will demand acceptance of the Bill, and upon refuſal Proteſt for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptance, or keep the Bill by me, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſent it to the Party on whom it is drawn, until the Bill fall due, and then go and demand the Mony; and if the Mony be not paid Proteſt only for non-payment, and upon that Proteſt recover upon the Drawer as well as if I had proteſted for non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſent it back to my Factor or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? Truly, in this caſe there ſeemeth to be more reaſon, why it ſhould be arbitrary in me to get acceptance of the Bill of Exchange, becauſe the Monies which were delivered are my own Monies, and the accepting of the Bill is but as another ſtring to the Bow; but if we examin the buſineſs a little further, neither in this caſe will it be found arbitrary in me to endeavour acceptance or not: for admit the Monies remitted are mine own, yet muſt I receive it in a legal way. I cannot receive my Mony of the Party on whom the Bill is drawn before it be due, neither can I without diſcharging the Drawer contract with the Party on whom it is drawn for a longer time than is mentioned in the Bill; ſo that although it be mine own Monies which are remitted, yet I am tyed to follow the cuſtom of Merchants, and I muſt not prejudice neither the Drawer, nor the Party on whom it is drawn, nor mine own Servant or Factor the deliverer. Now if the Bill is drawn at double uſance, and I keep it by me without preſenting it until it fall due, the Drawer in all that while, not having any advice whether it be accepted or not, may ſuffer much damage in reference to the Party on whom it was drawn, ſuppoſing him to have accepted the Bill: Or on the other ſide, the Party on whom the Bill is drawn may ſuffer in his credit or eſteem with the Drawer, who is held in doubt whether the Bill be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or not, and ſo whether probably it will be paid or not at the time; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer (though only a Factor or Servant)<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98306:230"/>muſt have advice whether the parcel be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted or not, to govern himſelf accordingly, and doubtleſs will be glad to hear the parcels he remitteth are accepted, and be troubled at the contrary; wherefore although the Monies are remitted me for mine own Account, yet becauſe the Bill of Exchange doth concern other men as well as my ſelf, therefore I ought to have reſpect unto them alſo, and to follow the uſual courſe of Exchange, which is, to endeavour to procure acceptation of Bills of Exchange, as well as payment; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the very Letter of Advice, which is ſent by the Deliverer of the Mony (be he Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Factor or Principal) to the party to whom the Bills are made payable, it is uſually expreſſed in theſe or the like words; Sir, here incloſed I do ſend you four Bills of Exchange for 500 <hi>l. viz.</hi>

                     <p>A Bill of Exchange which is accepted, and at the time not punctually paid, there are other ſome that think, if they ſhould cauſe a Proteſt to be made on ſuch a Bill for non-payment, that they by proteſting ſhould free the party who hath accepted the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and that they do reſerve their right only againſt the Drawer of the Bill to recover upon him by virtue of the Proteſt. To this I ſay, It is true, by proteſting the Drawer is liable to make ſatisfaction, but the party which accepted the Bill is ſo far thereby (I mean by proteſting for want of preſent pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) from being freed, as that he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made more liable, or at leaſt liable to pay more than he was before the Proteſt was made; for then he was only liable for the juſt ſum mentioned in the Bill, but now after Proteſt is made for non payment, he is liable alſo to pay all coſts, dammages, and intereſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the party proteſting doth by his Proteſt expreſly declare, he doth intend to recover of the Acceptor in uſual manner; and indeed, a Proteſt for non-payment ought uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to precede an action at Law: For by the Proteſt is proved default of payment of the Mony at the time limited in the Bill, and ſo the Acceptor becomes liable to an Action of the Caſe, and ſo ſoon as ever Proteſt hath been made for non-payment, the party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting may be arreſted thereupon, which before he could not ſo legally have been.</p>

                     <p>I anſwer, That can hardly be, I mean, that the ſecond Bill ſhould come payable to another man, if the firſt be made payable (in the Bill or by orderly aſſignment) to the party to whom you have paid the Mony: And yet ſuppoſe the firſt accepted Bill which was loſt was payable, or aſſigned to him that loſt it, and a ſecond Bill ſhould come aſſigned to another man, (as I have ſeen ſuch a thing happen, the honeſty of him that did it I will not now diſpute) the Mony being really paid at the time when the ſame fell due to him that had the accepted Bill, and payable to him, and not having had notice of the other Bill until after it be due, the payment on, or according to the firſt Bill, is good and warrantable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But what if the firſt accepted Bill be afterwards found by any that ſhall come and demand the Mony in the name of the party to whom it is payable, or that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall have aſſigned it over to another man, and have taken up the value of him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> It is all as nothing, coming after the time, and the Mony having been paid at the time to the party to whom payable, (though without the accepted Bill, it being ſuppoſed loſt) and having good Bond to ſave harmleſs; It will lie on him which hath committed the fraud, and not on the party<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98306:233"/>on whom the Bill was drawn, and hath paid it at the time, who is free from both firſt and ſecond Bill, and ought to be ſaved harmleſs accordingly.</p>

                     <p>YOu are to take ſpecial notice, that the day on which any

<hi>France,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> Poſt ſhall happen to depart on the ſecond day after it be due, or that the third day be a Sunday, or no working day, or day of publick commerce and trade: And in any of thoſe caſes the Mony muſt be paid the ſecond day after the Bill falls due, or elſe Proteſt muſt be then made for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment, that ſo lawful diligence may be uſed within the three days, and advice thereof may be ſent away by the very firſt Poſt after the Bill falls due: For although three days are uſually allowed after a Bill is due, yet it is with this proviſo, that the ſame be not to the prejudice of him to whom the Bill is payable, or of his Correſpondent, or the Drawer; for if the Mony be not paid, and the Proteſt made within the three days next after the Bill falls due, and that there ſhould happen in the interim any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to the party on whom the Bill is drawn, that he ſhould be non ſolvent, or the like, thoſe in

<hi>London,</hi> proteſt ought to be made for non-payment within three days after the Bill falls due, and the proteſt ought to be ſent away by the firſt Poſt next after the time of payment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, be it for what part ſoever. I know there are ſome that would not have Sunday reckoned for one of the three days after a Bill falls due; Truly, I think they may as well not reckon Sundays to be any of the thirty days ſight, or the like; for my part (though payments are not uſed to be made on Sundays, neither ought proteſt to be made on a Sunday for non-payment) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reckon Sunday amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the three days, for I am ſure if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday be the ſecond day after the Bill is due, then Monday will be the fourth day after it is due; Sure bind, ſure find.</p>

<hi>France</hi>) may happen to delay (if not free) the ſecond payment thereof upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for although the Drawer is bound to the deliverer until the bill be ſatisfied, yet it is with this proviſo, that proteſt be made in due time, and lawful diligence uſed for receipt of the mony by the party to whom it is payable, according to his duty, that ſo the Drawer may not ſuffer through his neglect: It is good to walk ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, there is no danger at all in proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the three days after a <hi>Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> is due, but there may be danger in forbearing to proteſt within that time: Wherefore my advice is, (let the party up on whom the Bill is drawn be never ſo good and able a man) if he do not pay within the time accuſtomed, cauſe the Bill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be proteſted for non-payment.</p>

                     <p>This <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> will not be due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ninth day of <hi>March</hi> Engliſh ſtile, and it cannot be accounted due (as ſome would have it) on the twenty ſeventh of <hi>February</hi> old ſtile, which is the ninth of <hi>March</hi> new ſtile; for it relates to the ſtile of the place where the bill is made payable, and not to the computation of the place or country where the Bill is dated. For ſuppoſe now Mr. <hi>Robert W.</hi> in the Bill mentioned ſhould demand payment of this Bill on the laſt of <hi>February</hi> and firſt of <hi>March</hi> old ſtile, and Mr. <hi>George H.</hi> ſhould tell him, that he would pay it the ninth of <hi>March</hi> our ſtile, when due according to the tenor of the Bill, and not before, I would fain know how any Notary (if he underſtand himſelf) can proteſt upon ſuch an anſwer, or can draw out any legal proteſt for non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the ninth of <hi>March</hi> old ſtile be expired: For (pray obſerve) if the Notary dateth his proteſt for non-payment on any day before the ninth of <hi>March</hi> old ſtile, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the computation of the place where the bill is payable, he will make his proteſt bear date before the bill is due, and ſo will be illegally made, and even the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it ſelf will carry that along with it which will certainly cut its own throat; for the bill is made payable the ninth, and the proteſt will bear date before the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be come, as may evidently appear: And yet this very caſe (to my knowledge) hath ſtumbled a Merchant of no ſmall rank and commerce in <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> who having ſuch a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> payable to him, would fam have perſuaded himſelf (for the acceptor, nor me he could not,) that the bill would be due the 27 old ſtile, and if the party on whom the bill was drawn would not ſo accept it, my Merchant was very earneſt to have a proteſt made; whereupon to make things plain, and thereby convince him of his errour, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the acceptor to underwrite the Bill thus, <hi>Accepted to pay the ninth of</hi> March, <hi>according to the tenor of the Bill,</hi> which when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98306:235"/>my Merchant beheld and well conſidered, he perceived his error, and well approved of the acceptance (for it was good) and ſo tarryed till the ninth of <hi>March</hi> for his mony, as he ought to do.</p>

                     <p>YOu may pleaſe to take notice, That generally in all Bills of Exchange the party that draws or under writes the Bill, (or the taker, which is all one) I ſay he is bound to the deliverer, or to the party of whom the value was received; and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, or party that doth accept the Bill, is bound to the party to whom the Bill is made payable: For although as well the Taker (or Drawer of the Bill) as alſo the Acceptor, are both bound in the Bill, and both equally liable for the payment thereof, yet they are not generally both bound to one man; I ſay generally, for if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer be ſervant to the party to whom the Bill is payable, then indeed the Drawer may be ſaid to be bound to the party to whom it is payable as well as the Acceptor: Or, if the Deliverer be the principal, and he remits his own monies by exchange, payable to his ſervant, in this caſe likewiſe both Taker and Acceptor may be ſaid to be bound to the Deliverer: But generally in parcels remitted and taken up by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change between Merchant and Merchant, the Taker is properly bound to one, and the Acceptor to another, though both of them are liable until the Bill be ſatisfied: So<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98306:235"/>that if the accepted Bill be not paid at the time, and proteſt made for non-payment, and there be occaſion to commence a ſute in Law againſt the Drawer, it muſt be entred in the name of the Deliverer; and in like manner, if a ſute be commenced againſt the Acceptor, it muſt be made and proſecuted in the name of the party to whom the Bill is made payable, for the party (happily) that draws the Bill takes no great notice to whom it is made payable, (he being thereunto directed uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the party that delivers him the value;) Neither doth the party which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the Bill take much cognizance of the party that did deliver the value, but only of the party that drew the Bill, (with whom he correſponds,) and of the party to whom it is made payable, (to whom by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance he bindeth himſelf for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;) And ſo likewiſe where there are any Aſſignments on Bills negotiated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the party that receives the value is directly bound to him of whom he hath received it, and the Acceptor to the laſt aſſigned.</p>

                     <head>Proteſt in the day time.</head>
                     <p>IF at any time you have occaſion to cauſe proteſt to be made on any <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> either for non-acceptance, better ſecurity, or for want of payment, always be ſure to cauſe proteſt to be made in the day time, that is to ſay, between ſun riſing and ſun ſetting, but tarry not until the laſt hour, if you may do otherwiſe; and when I ſay between ſun and ſun, my meaning is, in the day time, or time of commerce and publick trade, when, and during the time that ſhops are generally open, for one ſwallow doth not make a ſummer; For it may be in ſummer time in <hi>London</hi> ſome men do open ſhops by four or five of the clock in the morning, but generally not until ſix or ſeven, and ſome do not ſhut up until nine or ten, but generally at ſeven or eight of the clock: And again, in winter haply ſome may open about ſix or ſeven of the clock in the morning, and ſhut up not until nine or ten, whenas generally they open about eight, and ſhut up about four or five of the clock at evening: So that as a <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> is of great concernment to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in trade, and a proteſt upon any of their Bills may prove to their great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit;
<note place="margin">A Caveat for <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                        </note>ſo likewiſe it is therefore provided by the Law and cuſtom of Merchants, that no proteſt upon any of their <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> ought to be made againſt them out of ſeaſon, or at an unſeaſonable time, when men generally ceaſe to uſe publick commerce and trade; for there is a time of reſt as well as a time of labour, a time for devotion as well as a time of negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a time for private imployment, as well as for publick concernment. If I ſhould go about ten of the clock at night to a Merchant to buy a parcel of Taffaties, would he not be ready to excuſe the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them at ſuch an unſeaſonable hour, and deſire me rather to come the next morning about nine of the clock, and that then I ſhould ſee them, and in ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering me, wherein doth he deſerve blame, may not he for all that continue to be a Merchant of good repute? Becauſe he will not ſhew his goods at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable hour, can any therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he hath no goods to ſell? Ought not I rather to be blamed to give diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to him at ſuch an hour of the night? I could ſay much in this particular: but as I deſire not to give advantage to any ill affected to forbear payment of monies due by <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> whenſoever the ſame is juſtly and rightly demanded, ſo I dare not conclude a proteſt to be legally made at any hour of the night, or at an unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time; You cannot err in cauſing proteſt to be made (if occaſion be) on a working day before noon, or after noon, in the time that men do generally uſe and exerciſe commerce and trade, as well in <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98306:236"/>buying and ſelling of goods, as in paying and receiving of monies: And therefore to prevent all objections which may be made againſt the legality of the proteſt,

                           <hi>Nota.</hi>
                        </note>I would adviſe every one that hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cauſe proteſt to be made for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment to play above board, and to let their proteſt be made at convenient time, as is before declared; for you are not bound not to proteſt until the laſt hour of the third day after the Bill is due, but you are bound by the Law of Merchants, uſed in <hi>England,</hi> to proteſt within the three days, and before the laſt hour be expired, which is generally taken at ſun ſetting, or thereabouts; wherefore you may as well proteſt in the forenoon as in the afternoon, and as well at two of the clock in the afternoon as at four of the clock: And therefore be ſure you do not prejudice your ſelf in tarrying beyond your time before you cauſe proteſt to be made for non-payment of your Bill, in caſe it be not paid before the third day.</p>

<hi>Freight-Letters,</hi> and others <hi>Letters of Credit: Letters of Commiſſion</hi> are for buying or ſelling of Goods, freighting Ships, taking up Mony or remitting Mony by Exchange or the like: <hi>Letters of Advice</hi> are ſuch as I write to my Friend, Servant, Correſpondent, or Principal, adviſing them of Monies drawn or remitted by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;
<hi>Freight-Letters</hi> are ſuch as are written upon the Freighting, or taking to Freight any Ship or Veſſel, or any Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thereof, informing what Tunnage is taken to freight, and what Freight is to be paid for the ſame; <hi>Letters of Credit</hi> are properly ſuch as are written to furniſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Exchange upon the Credit of him who writes the
<hi>Letter:</hi> theſe <hi>Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> (in regard they do more immediately concern the Credit and Honour of the Party who writes the ſame, ſuppoſing him to be a Merchant or Trader, whoſe beſt and chiefeſt Subſiſtance is Credit) muſt needs be of greateſt concern, and moſt binding by, or from the Party or Parties who under-write or ſubſcribe the ſame, to thoſe to whom they are directed, or who are concern'd therein, in caſe he or they ſhall comply therewith; becauſe the Credit of him who under-writes the <hi>Letter</hi> is thereby vindicated, and his Honour, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and Eſteem much manifeſted. Now <hi>Letters of Credit</hi> for the furniſhing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by Exchange, are of two ſorts, the one
<hi>General</hi> the other <hi>Special:</hi> The <hi>General Letter of Credit</hi> is, when I write my open <hi>Letter</hi> directed to all Merchants and others that ſhall furniſh Monies to ſuch and ſuch Perſons upon this my <hi>Letter of Credit,</hi> in and by which I bind my ſelf, that what Monies ſhall be by them deliver'd unto the Party or Parties therein mention'd, within ſuch a time at ſuch and ſuch Rates, (or in general terms, at the Price currant) I do thereby bind my ſelf to be accountable and anſwerable for the ſame to be repaid accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Bill</hi> or
<hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which upon receipt of the Mony ſo furniſh'd ſhall be given or deliver'd for the ſame; and if any Mony be furniſh'd upon ſuch my <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letter of Credit,</hi> and <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> therefore given, and charg'd, drawn or directed to me, altho when the Bills come to hand, and are preſented to me, I ſhould refuſe to accept thereof, yet (according to the Cuſtom of Merchants) I am bound and liable to the payment of thoſe <hi>Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> by virtue and force of ſuch my <hi>General Letter of Credit;</hi> becauſe he or they who furniſh the Mony, have not ſo much (if any) reſpect to the Sufficiency or Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Party who takes up the Mony, as to me who have given my
<hi>Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> for the ſame, and upon whoſe Credit meerly thoſe Monies may be properly ſaid to have been deliver'd: The <hi>Special Letter of Credit</hi> is, when a Merchant, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of another Man, writes his open <hi>Letter of Credit,</hi> directed to his Factor, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or Correſpondent, giving him order to furniſh ſuch or ſuch a Man by name, with ſuch or ſuch a Sum of Mony, at one or more times, and charge it to accompt of the Merchant who gives the <hi>Letter of Credit</hi> and takes
<hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> or Receipts for the ſame; <hi>Particular Letters of Credit</hi> are uſually writ and ſubſcribed with the own hand of the Merchant that grants them, wherein it is very expedient, (as well for the certainty of him who is to furniſh the Monies, that he may be ſure the
<hi>Letters</hi> come directly from the Merchant, and ſo his Credit may not ſuffer through any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma or Demur in compliance, by reaſon of any Doubt which may be of the Reality of the <hi>Letter,</hi> as for the plain meaning and obligation of the Merchant himſelf to be reſponſible for the ſame) that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant do mention or recite ſomething or other particularly which hath happen'd in ſome former Affairs or Dealings, or which is yet depending between them, or at leaſt the Date of his laſt <hi>Letter.</hi> Now, in the
<hi>General Letter of Credit,</hi> he that writes it makes uſe of his Credit for his own account and concern in his way of Trade, and ſo there needs no more than his <hi>Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> to make him liable to repay what ſhall be ſo furniſh'd; but in the <hi>Particular Letter of Credit,</hi> he who writes the <hi>Letter,</hi> does it not to make uſe of the Monies himſelf, or to be imploy'd for his own uſe, but for the uſe and accommodation of ſome other Man, at whoſe requeſt he is willing and doth write his <hi>Letter of Credit;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very expedient and ordinary for him, at whoſe intreaty the <hi>Letter</hi> is written,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98306:239"/>at the writing, and upon receipt thereof, to give good Security, by Bond or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to the Merchant that gives the <hi>Letter of Credit,</hi> for Repayment to him, his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors or Aſſigns, of all ſuch Monies as ſhall be receiv'd by virtue of the ſaid <hi>Letter of Credit:</hi> for the Merchant, by his <hi>Letter,</hi> ſtands ſufficiently bound to his Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore it is but reaſon that he, for whom the <hi>Letter</hi> is granted ſhould give (as it were) his Counterbond for Repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which are to be made for Monies taken up by <hi>Letters of Credit,</hi> do run in the ordinary form of
<hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> whereof I have ſet down ſeveral towards the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; as for the Form of the <hi>General Letter of Credit</hi> (in regard each Man knows beſt his own occaſions inducing him thereunto, whereof the <hi>Letter</hi> muſt chiefly conſiſt) I ſhall wave it, and only ſet down the Form of a <hi>Particular Letter of Credit,</hi> which may be as follows.</p>

                  <head>Directions concerning the two enſuing Tables.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt Table is for any Year except Leap-year. The ſecond Table is for Leap-year only, which happens every fourth year, as namely,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1700, 1704, 1708, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt Column of either of theſe Tables I have put the
<hi>New Stile</hi> (or the <hi>Roman Account</hi>) of the days in the year, in regard it is ten days before our <hi>Engliſh Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;</hi> And I have plac'd the <hi>Engliſh Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> or <hi>Old Stile</hi> in the ſecond Column, and ſo again the <hi>New Stile</hi> in the third Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and our
<hi>Engliſh Stile</hi> in the fourth, and ſo forward, from the left-hand to the right, every odd Column which hath the Month nam'd at the top thereof is the <hi>New Stile Account,</hi> and every ſecond or even Column, which hath not the month writ at the top is the <hi>Old Stile Account:</hi> as you may perceive, becauſe the Month begins juſt ten days after they are begun by the <hi>New Account:</hi> And in both theſe Tables I have exactly counted day for day, and ſet them ſide by ſide, upon an equal and ſtreit line from the left hand to the right, from <hi>New Stile</hi> to <hi>Old Stile</hi> for every day in the year; Leap-year containing 366 days, and the ordinary year 365 days; each <hi>Stile</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the other, even to the very ſame day of the Week.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Tables may exactly be known when <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> made payable at U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, or Uſances, will fall due from
<hi>New Stile</hi> to <hi>Old Stile:</hi> Thus a Bill dated the firſt of
<hi>January</hi> 1655, <hi>New Stile,</hi> payable at double Uſance in
<hi>London;</hi> to know when this Bill is due, firſt I enter the firſt Table, and find <hi>January</hi> 1. <hi>New Stile</hi> to be <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
22. <hi>Old ſtile,</hi> which is the Date of the Bill, then I go ſtreit along the ſame line, and in the fourth Column towards my right hand, I find
22 (which is <hi>January</hi> 22) that is one Uſance, and yet along the ſame line in the ſixth Column, I find 19, which is <hi>February</hi> 19, being the day on which the Bill is due: Again, a Bill dated <hi>January</hi> 8.
1665. <hi>New Stile,</hi> payable at double Uſance, having found the date in the firſt Table, I go ſtreit along the ſame line from <hi>January</hi> 8. on my left-hand, to the ſixth Column towards my right, where I find
<hi>February</hi> 26. <hi>Old Stile,</hi> on which day the Bill will fall due; in like manner, a Bill dated <hi>January</hi> 10. <hi>New Stile</hi> at Uſance, will be due <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 31 <hi>Old Stile,</hi> and payable at double Uſance, will be due <hi>February</hi> 28 <hi>Old Stile,</hi> if not in Leap-year; but if it be in Leap-year, then I make uſe of the ſecond Table ſerving for Leap-year, and I do there find that a Bill dated the firſt of
<hi>January</hi> at dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſance, will be due in <hi>London Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
20. <hi>Old Stile.</hi> Again, a Bill dated in Leap-year <hi>January</hi> 8.
<hi>New Stile</hi> at double Uſance, will be due <hi>February</hi> 27.
<hi>Old Stile;</hi> And a Bill dated <hi>January</hi> 10. <hi>New Stile</hi> at double Uſance, will be due <hi>February</hi> 29. <hi>Old Stile.</hi> And ſo of any other date of <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> payable at any Uſances, or Uſance, and half, or the like; firſt find out the date of your Bill in the Tables, and then look ſtreit upon the ſame line every other Column towards your right-hand, you will find the Uſance, or Uſances, ſet down according to the <hi>Engliſh Account,</hi> and for half Uſance you muſt always rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon fifteen days forward; Theſe Tables are ſo exactly made that they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any, but may ſerve as a competent Judg in reſolving many Doubts, Scruples and Queſtions that may ariſe between Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Party, concerning the preciſe day on which any <hi>Bill of Exchange</hi> will fall due as aforeſaid; which in regard (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) it is plainly ſet down in each Table, therefore I ſhall forbear any further Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof.</p>

                  <p>MY <hi>Son,</hi> In a former Diſcourſe I have endeavoured, after my manner, briefly to teach thee two things: The firſt is
<hi>Piety,</hi> how to fear God aright, according to his Works and Word: The ſecond is <hi>Policy,</hi> how to Love and Serve thy Country, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing thee in the Duties and Proceedings of ſundry Vocations, which either <hi>order,</hi> or elſe <hi>act</hi> the Affairs of the Common-wealth; In which as ſome things do eſpecially tend to <hi>Preſerve,</hi> and others are more apt to <hi>Enlarge</hi> the ſame: So am I now to ſpeak of
<hi>Mony,</hi> which doth indifferently ſerve to both theſe happy ends. Wherein I will obſerve this Order, Firſt, to ſhew the general Means whereby a Kingdom may be enriched; and then proceed to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Courſes by which Princes are accuſtomed to be ſupplied with

                  <head>CHAP. I. The Qualities which are required in a perfect Merchant of Forein Trade.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">As it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to know what is to be done by others in their Places: So it were a great ſhame to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Duties of our own Vacations.</note>THE Love and Service of our Country conſiſteth not ſo much in the Knowledge of thoſe Duties which are to be performed by others, as in the skilful Practice, of that which is done by our ſelves; and therefore (my Son) it is now fit that I ſay ſomething of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, which I hope in due time ſhall be thy Vocation: Yet herein are my Thoughts free from all Ambition, although I rank thee in a Place of ſo high eſtimation; for the Merchant is worthily called, <hi>The Steward of the Kingdom's Stock,</hi> by way of Commerce with other Nations; a Work of no leſs <hi>Reputation</hi> than <hi>Truſt,</hi> which ought to be performed with great Skill and Conſcience, that ſo the Private Gain may ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Publick Good. And becauſe the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this Profeſſion may the better ſtir up thy Deſires and Endeavours to obtain thoſe Abilities which may effect it worthily, I will briefly ſet down the excellent Qualities which are required in a perfect Merchant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ought to be a good Pen-man, a good Arithmetician, and a good accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, by that Noble Order of <hi>Debtor</hi> and
<hi>Creditor,</hi> which is uſed only amongſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; alſo to be expert in the Order and Form of <hi>Charter-parties, Bills of Lading, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voices, Contracts, Bills of Exchange, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of Enſurance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ought to know the Meaſures, Weights, and Monies of all Forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, eſpecially where we have Trade, and the Monies not only by their ſeveral Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, but alſo by their Intrinſick Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues in Weight and Fineneſs, compared with the Standard of this Kingdom, without which he cannot well direct his Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ought to know the Cuſtoms, Tolls, Taxes, Impoſitions, Conducts, and other charges upon all manner of Merchandize, Exported or Imported to and from the ſaid Forein Countries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ought to know in what ſeveral Commodities each Country abounds, and what be the Wares which they want,<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98306:243"/>and how and from whence they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He ought to underſtand, and to be a diligent Obſerver of the Rates of Exchanges by Bills, from one State to another, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may the better direct his Affairs, and remit over and receive home his Monies to the moſt advantage poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He ought to know what Goods are prohibited to be Exported or Imported in the ſaid Forein Countries, leſt otherwiſe he ſhould incur great Danger and Loſs in the ordering of his Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He ought to know upon what Rates and Conditions to Freight his Ships, and Enſure his Adventures from one Country to another, and to be well acquainted with the Laws, Orders and Cuſtoms of the Inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance-Office, both here and beyond the Seas, in the many Accidents which may happen upon the Damage or Loſs of Ships or Goods, or both.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He ought to have Knowledg in the Goodneſs and in the Prices of all the ſeveral Materials which are required for the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Repairing of Ships, and the divers Workmanſhips of the ſame, as alſo for the Maſts, Tackling, Cordage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Ordnance, Victuals, Munition, and Proviſions of many kinds; together with the ordinary Wages of <hi>Commanders, Officers,</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> all which concern the Merchant as he is an Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ships.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He ought (by the divers Occaſions which happen ſometimes in the Buying and Selling of one Commodity and ſometimes in another) to have indifferent if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledg in all manner of erchandze or Wares, which is to be as it were a Man of all Occupations and Trades.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He ought by his Voyaging on the Seas to become skilful in the Art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He ought as he is a Traveller, and ſometimes abiding in Forein Countries to attain to the ſpeaking of divers Languages, and to be a diligent Obſerver of the ordinary Revenues and Expences of Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, together with their Strength both by Sea and Land, their Laws, Cuſtoms, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Manners, Religions, Arts, and the like; to be able to give account thereof in all occaſions for the Good of his Country.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Laſtly, Although there be no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſuch a Merchant ſhould be a great Scholar; yet is it (at leaſt) required, that in his Youth he learn the Latin Tongue, which will the better enable him in all the reſt of his Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I brieflly ſhewed thee a Pattern for thy Diligence, the Merchant in his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; which in truth, are ſuch, and ſo many, that I find no other Profeſſion which leadeth into more wordly Knowledge. And it cannot be denied but that their Sufficiency doth appear likewiſe in the excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of State at <hi>Venice, Luca, Genoua, Florence,</hi> the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Places of Chriſtendom And in thoſe States alſo where they are leaſt eſteemed, yet is there Skill and Knowledg often uſed by thoſe who ſit in the higheſt Places of Authority: It is therefore an Act beyond raſhneſs in ſome, who diſenable their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Judgment, (even in Books printed) making them uncapable of thoſe Ways and Means which do either Enrich or Empove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a Common wealth, when in truth, this is only effected by the Myſtery of their Trade, as I ſhall plainly ſhew in that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. It is true indeed, that many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants here in <hi>England,</hi> finding leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement given to their Profeſſion than in other Countries, and ſeeing themſelves not ſo well eſteemed as their <hi>Noble Vocation</hi> requireth, and according to the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the ſame, do not therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to attain unto the Excellency of their Profeſſion, neither is it practiſed by the <hi>Nobility</hi> of this Kingdom, as it is in other States, from the Father to the Son through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Generations, to their great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Wealth, and maintenance of their Names and Families:
<note place="margin">There is more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Profit in an Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Life, than in a great Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which waſteth for want of Vertue</note>Whereas the Memory of our richeſt Merchants is ſuddenly extinguiſhed; the Son being left rich, ſcorneth the Profeſſion of his Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving more Honour to be a Gentleman, (although but in Name) to conſume his Eſtate in dark Ignorance and Exceſs, than to follow the Steps of his Father as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Merchant to maintain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>But now leaving the Merchant's Praiſe, we will come to his Practice, or at leaſt to ſo much thereof as concerns the bringing of Treaſure into the Kingdom.</p>

               <div n="2" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. II. The Means to enrich this Kingdom, and to encreaſe our Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>ALthough a Kingdom may be Enriched by Gifts received, or by Purchaſe taken from ſome other Nations, yet theſe are things uncertain, and of ſmall Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration when they happen.
<note place="margin">Forein Trade is the Rule of our Treaſure.</note>The ordinary Means therefore to increaſe our Wealth and Treaſure is by <hi>Forein Trade,</hi> wherein we muſt ever obſerve this Rule, to ſell more to Strangers yearly, than we conſume of theirs in value. For ſuppoſe, that when this Kingdom is plentifully ſerved with the Cloth, Lead, Tin, Iron, Fiſh, and other <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98306:243"/>Native Commodities, we do yearly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Overplus to Forein Countries, to the Value of Twenty two hundred thouſand pounds; by which means we are enabled beyond the Seas to buy and bring in Forein Wares for our Uſe and Conſumptions, to the value of Twenty hundred thouſand Pounds: By this Order duly kept in our Trading, we may reſt aſſured, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be Enriched yearly two hundred thouſand Pounds, which muſt be brought to us in ſo much Treaſure; becauſe that part of our Stock which is not returned to us in Wares, muſt neceſſarily be brought home in Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>For in this caſe it cometh to paſs in the Stock of a Kingdom, as in the Eſtate of a private Man; who is ſuppoſed to have One thouſand Pounds yearly Revenue, and Two thouſand Pounds of ready Mony in his Cheſt: If ſuch a Man, through Exceſs, ſhall ſpend One thouſand five hundred Pounds <hi>per An.</hi> all his ready Mony will be gone in four years; and in the like time his ſaid Mony will be doubled, if he take a Frugal Courſe to ſpend but Five hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> which Rule never faileth likewiſe in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but in ſome caſes (of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which I will hereafter declare, when I ſhall ſhew by whom and in what manner this Ballance of the Kingdom's Account ought to be drawn up yearly, or ſo often as it ſhall pleaſe the State to diſcover how much we Gain or Loſe by Trade with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Nations. But firſt I will ſay ſomething concerning thoſe Ways and Means which will Increaſe our Exportations and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our Importations of VVares; which being done, I will then ſet down ſome other Arguments both Affirmative and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, to ſtrengthen that which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and thereby to ſhew, that all the other Means which are commonly ſuppoſed to Enrich the Kingdom with Treaſure, are altogether Inſufficient and meer Fallacies.</p>

               <div n="3" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. III. The particular Ways and Means to increaſe the Exportation of our Commodities, and to decreaſe our Conſumption of Forein Wares.</head>
                  <p>THE Revenue or Stock of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which it is provided of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Wares is either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial.</hi> The Natural Wealth is ſo much only as can be ſpared from our own Uſe and Neceſſities, to be exported unto Strangers. The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial conſiſts in our Manufactures and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Trading with Forein Commodities, concerning which I will ſet down ſuch Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as may ſerve for the Cauſe we have in hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">Firſt, Although this Realm be already exceeding Rich by Nature, yet might it be much increaſed by laying the waſte Grounds (which are infinite,) into ſuch Employments as ſhould no way hinder the preſent Revenues of other manured Lands, but hereby to ſupply our ſelves, and prevent the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hemp, Flax, Cordage, Tobacco, and divers other things which now we fetch from Strangers to our great Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may likewiſe diminiſh our Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, if we would ſoberly refrain from exceſſive Conſumption of Forein Wares in our Diet and Rayment, with ſuch often change of Faſhions as is uſed, ſo much the more to increaſe the Waſte and Charge; which Vices at this preſent are more Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious amongſt us than in former Ages. Yet might they eaſily be amended by enforcing the Obſervation of ſuch good Laws, as are ſtrictly practiſed in other Countries, againſt the ſaid Exceſſes; where likewiſe, by commanding their own Manufactures to be uſed, they prevent the coming in of others, without Prohibition, or Offence to Strangers in their mutual Commerce.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In our Exportations we muſt not only regard our own Superfluities, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our Neighbours Neceſſities, that ſo, upon the VVares which they cannot want, nor yet be furniſhed therewith elſewhere, we may (beſides the vent of Materials,) gain ſo much of the Manufacture as we can, and alſo endeavour to ſell them dear, ſo far forth as the high Price cauſe not a leſs vent in the Quantity. But the Superfluity of our Commodities which Strangers uſe, and may alſo have the ſame from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or may abate their vent by the uſe of ſome ſuch like VVares from other Places, and with little Inconvenience; we muſt in this caſe ſtrive to ſell as cheap as poſſible we can, rather than to loſe the Utterance of ſuch VVares. For we have found of late Years, by good Experience, that being able to ſell our Cloth cheap in <hi>Turky,</hi> we have greatly increaſed the vent thereof, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> have loſt as much in the Utterance of theirs in thoſe Countries becauſe it is dearer. And on the other ſide, a ſew Years paſt, when, by the exceſſive Prices of VVools, our Cloth was exceeding dear, we loſt at leaſt half our Clothing for Forein Parts, which ſince is no otherwiſe (well near) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again than by the great fall of Price for VVeols and Cloth.
<note place="margin">The State in ſome Occaſions may gain moſt, when pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men by their Reventles get leaſt.</note>VVe find that Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five in the Hundred leſs in the Price of theſe and ſome other VVares, to the loſs of private Mens Revenues, may raiſe above Fifty upon the Hundred in the Quantity vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Benefit of the Publick. For when Cloth is dear, other Nations do preſently<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98306:244"/>practice Clothing, and we know they want neither Art nor Materials to this Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But when by Cheapneſs we drive them from this Employment, and ſo in time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our dear Price again, then do they alſo uſe their former Remedy. So that by theſe Alterations we learn, that is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a greater Revenue of our Wares than their Condition will afford, but rather it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to apply our endeavours to the Times, with Care and Diligence to help our ſelves the beſt we may, by making our Cloth and other Manufactures without Deceit, which will increaſe their Eſtimation and Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Value of our Exportations like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be much advanced when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it our ſelves in our own Ships, for then we get not only the Price of our Wares as they are worth here, but alſo the Merchant's Gains, the Charges of Inſurance, and Freight to carry them beyond the Seas. As for Example, If the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants ſhould come hither in their own Shipping to fetch our Corn, our Red-Herrings, or the like, in this Caſe the Kingdom ſhould have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily but 25 <hi>s.</hi> for a Quarter of Wheat, and 20 <hi>s.</hi> for a Barrel of Red Herrings, whereas if we carry theſe Wares our ſelves into <hi>Italy</hi> upon the ſaid Rates, it is likely that we ſhall obtain Fifty ſhillings for the Firſt, and Forty ſhillings for the Laſt, which is a great Difference in the Utterance or Vent of the Kingdom's ſtock. And although it is true, that the Commerce ought to be free to Strangers to bring in and carry out at their pleaſure; yet nevertheleſs in many Places, the Exportation of Victuals and Munition are either prohibited, or at leaſt limited to be done only by the People and Shipping of thoſe Places where they abound.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Frugal expending likewiſe of our own Natural Wealth, might advance much yearly to be exported unto Strangers; and if in our Rayment we will be prodigal, yet let this be done with our own Materials and Manufactures, as Cloth, Lace, Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, Cut-works and the like; where the Exceſs of the Rich may be the Employment of the Poor, whoſe Labours, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this kind, would be more profitable for the Commonwealth, if they were done to the uſe of Strangers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Fiſhing in His Majeſty's Seas of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Wealth, and would coſt nothing but Labour, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> beſtow willingly, and thereby draw yearly a very great Profit to themſelves, by ſerving many places of Chriſtendom with our Fiſh, for which they return and ſupply their Wants both of Forein VVares and Mony, beſides the multitude of Mariners and Shipping, which hereby are maintain'd, whereof a long Diſcourſe might be made, to ſhew the particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of this Important Buſineſs. Our Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plantation likewiſe in <hi>New-England, Virginia, Greenland,</hi> the <hi>Summer Iſlands,</hi> and the <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> are of the like Nature, affording much VVealth and Employments to maintain a great number of Poor, and to increaſe our decaying Trade.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <note place="margin">How ſome States have been made Rich</note>7. A Staple or Magazine for Forein Corn, Indico, Spices, Raw-ſilks, Cotton, VVool, or any other Commodity whatſoever, to be Imported, will increaſe Shipping, Trade, Treaſure, and the Kings Cuſtoms, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them again where need ſhall require; which courſe of Trading, hath been the chief Means to raiſe <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi> the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with ſome others, and for ſuch a purpoſe

                  <p n="8">8. Alſo we ought to eſteem and cheriſh thoſe Trades which we have in remote or fax Countries; for beſides the Increaſe of Shipping and Mariners thereby, the VVares alſo ſent thither and receiv'd from thence are far more profitable unto the Kingdom, than by our Trades near at hand: As for Example, ſuppoſe Pepper to be worth here two ſhillings the Pound conſtantly, if then it be brought from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the Merchant may give there twenty pence the Pound, and gain well by the Bargain;
<note place="margin">The Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick to the Eaſt-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is our moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Trade in its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both for King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. We get more by the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Wares than the Indians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kingdoms Gain and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Profit.</note>but if he fetch this Pepper from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> he muſt not give above three pence the Pound at the moſt, which is a mighty Advantage, not only in that Part which ſerveth for our own uſe, but alſo for that great Quantity which (from heence) we tranſport yearly unto divers others Nations to be ſold at a higher Price; whereby it is plain, that we make a far greater Stock by Gain upon theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities, than thoſe Nations do where they Grow, and to whom they properly appertain, being the Natural VVealth of their Countries. But for the better underſtanding of this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we muſt ever diſtinguiſh between the Gain of the Kingdom, and the Profit of the Merchant; for although the Kingdom pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more for this Pepper than is before ſuppoſed, nor for any other Commodity bought in Forein Parts more than the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger receiveth from us for the ſame; yet the Merchant payeth not only that Price, but alſo the Freight, Enſurance, Cuſtoms, and other charges which are exceeding great in theſe long Voyages; but yet all theſe in the Kingdoms account are but commutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among our ſelves, and no Privation of the Kingdom's Stock, which being duly conſidered, together with the Support alſo<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98306:244"/>of our other Trades in our beſt Shipping to <hi>Italy, France, Turky,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Countries</hi> and other places, by Tranſporting and Vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wares which we bring yearly from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> It may well ſtir up our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavours to maintain and enlarge this Great and Noble Buſineſs, ſo much importing the Publick Wealth, Strength and Happineſs. Neither is there leſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Judgment by growing Rich (in this manner) upon the Stock of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than by an induſtrious Increaſe of our own Means; eſpecially when this Latter is advanced by the Benefit of the Formers as we have found in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> by ſale of much of our Tin, Cloth, Lead and other Commodities, the Vent whereof doth daily increaſe in thoſe Countries which formerly had no uſe of our Wares.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It would be very beneficial to Export Mony as well as Wares, being done in Trade only, it would increaſe our Treaſure; but of this I write more largely in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove it plainly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It were Policy and Profit for the State to ſuffer Manufactures made of Forein Materials to be exported Cuſtom-free, as Velvets, and all other wrought Silks, Fuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Thrown Silks, and the like, it would employ very many poor People, and much increaſe the Value of our Stock yearly iſſued into other Countries, and it would (for this Purpoſe) cauſe the more Forein Materials to be brought in, to the Emprovement of His Majeſties Cuſtoms. I will here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a notable Increaſe in our Manufacture of Winding and Twiſting only of Forein raw Silk, which within 35 years to my knowledg, did not employ more than 300 People in the City and Suburbs of
<hi>London,</hi> where at this preſent time it doth ſet on work above fourteen thouſand Souls, as upon diligent Enquiry hath been credibly reported unto His Majeſties Commiſſioners for Trade. And it is certain, that if the ſaid Forein Commodities might be Exported from hence free of Cuſtom, this Manufacture would yet increaſe very much, and decreaſe as faſt in
<hi>Italy</hi> and in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> But if any Man alledge the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb, <hi>Live and let others live;</hi> I anſwer, that the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, notwithſtanding their own Proverb, do not only in theſe Kingdoms, encroach upon our Livings; but alſo in other Forein Parts of our Trade, (where they have power) they do hinder and deſtroy us in our lawful courſe of Living, hereby taking the Bread out of our Mouth, which we ſhall never prevent by plucking the Pot from their Noſe, as of late. Years too many of us do practiſe, to the great Diſhonour of this Famous Nation: We ought rather to imitate former times in taking ſober and worthy Courſes, more pleaſing to God, and ſuitable to our ancient Reputation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. It is needful alſo not to charge the Native Commodities with too great Cuſtoms, leſt by endearing them to the Strangers uſe, it hinder their Vent. And eſpecially, Forein Wares brought in to be Tranſported again, ſhould be ſavoured; for otherwiſe, that manner of Trading (ſo much importing the Good of the Commonwealth) cannot Proſper nor Subſiſt. But the Conſumption of ſuch Forein Wares in the Realm may be the more Charged, which will turn to the Profit of the Kingdom in the
<hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> and thereby alſo enable the King to lay up the more Treaſure out of his yearly Incoms; as of this Particular I intend to write more fully in its proper Place, where I ſhall ſhew how much Mony a Prince may conveniently lay up without the hurt of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Laſtly, In all things we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the moſt we can of our own, whether it be <hi>Natural</hi> or
<hi>Artificial;</hi> and foraſmuch as the People which live by the Arts are far more in number than they who are Maſters of the Fruits, we ought the more carefully to maintain thoſe Endeavours of the Multitude, in whom doth conſiſt the greateſt Strength and Riches both of King and Kingdom: For where the People are many, and the Arts good, there the Traffick muſt be greater, and the Country rich. The <hi>Italians</hi> employ a greates Number of People, and get more Mony by their Induſtry and Manufactures of the raw Silks of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Subjects have, by the Revenue of this rich Commodity. But what need we fetch the Example ſo far, when we know that our own Natural Wares do not yeild us ſo much profit as our induſtry? for Iron-Oar in the Mines is of no great worth, when it is compared with the Employment and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it yields, being Digged, Tried, Tranſported, Bought, Sold, Caſt into Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Muskets, and many other Inſtruments of War, for Offence and Defence; wrought into Anchors, Bolts, Spikes, Nails, and the like, for the uſe of Ships, Houſes, Carts, Coaches, Ploughs, and other Inſtruments for Tillage. Compare our Fleece-wools with our Cloth, which requires Shearing, Waſhing, Carding, Spinning, Weaving, Fulling, Dying, Dreſſing, and other Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and we ſhall find theſe Arts more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable than the Natural Wealth, whereof I might inſtance other Examples; but I will not be more tedious, for if I would amplifie upon this and the other Particulars before-written, I might find matter ſufficient to make a large Volume, but my deſire in all is only to prove what I propound with Brevity and Plainneſs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. The Exportation of our Monies in Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, is a Means to increaſe our Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>THis Poſition is ſo contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion, that it will require ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſtrong Arguments to prove it, before it can be accepted of the Multitude, who bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exclaim when they ſee any Monies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Realm; affirming thereupon that we have abſolutely loſt ſo much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that this is an act directly againſt the long continued Laws made and confirmed by the Wiſdom of this Kingdom in the High Court of Parliament; and that many places, nay <hi>Spain</hi> itſelf, which is the Fountain of Mony, forbids the Exportation thereof, ſome Caſes only excepted. To all which I might anſwer, that <hi>Venice, Florence, Genoua,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and divers other Places per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, their People applaud it, and find great Benefit by it; but all this makes a Noiſe and proves nothing; we muſt therefore come to thoſe Reaſons which concern the Buſineſs in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will take that for granted which no Man of Judgment will deny, that we have no other Means to get Treaſure but by Forein Trade, for Mines we have none which do afford it, and how this Mony is gotten in the Managing of our ſaid Trade, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, that it is done by making our Commodities which are Exported yearly, to over-ballance in value the Forein Wares which we conſume; ſo that it reſteth only to ſhew how our Monies may be added to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and being jointly Exported, may ſo much the more increaſe our Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſuppoſed our yearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of Forein Wares to be for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Twenty hundred thouſand Pounds, and our Exportations to exceed that Two hundred thouſand Pounds, which Sum we have thereupon affirmed is brought to us in Treaſure, to ballance the Accompt. But now if we add three hundred thouſand Pounds more in ready Mony, unto our former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations in Wares, what Profit can we have (will ſome Men ſay) although by this Means we ſhould bring in ſo much ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than we did before, ſeeing that we have carried out the like value?</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is, that when we have prepared our Exportations of Wares, and ſet out as much of every thing as we can ſpare or vent abroad:
<note place="margin">Mony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Trade and Trade increaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Mony.</note>It is not therefore ſaid, that then we ſhould add our Mony thereunto, to fetch in the more Mony immediately, but rather firſt to enlarge our Trade by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling us to bring in more Forein VVares, which being ſent out again, will in due time much increaſe our Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>For although in this manner, we do yearly multiply our Importations to the Mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of more Shipping and Mariners, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of His Majeſties Cuſtoms, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Benefits: yet our Conſumption of thoſe Forein VVares is no more than it was before; ſo that all the ſaid Increaſe of Commodities, brought in by the means of our ready Mony, ſent out as is afore written, doth in the end become an exportation unto us of a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Value than our ſaid Monies were, which is proved by three ſeveral Examples following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For I ſuppoſe that 100000 <hi>l.</hi> being ſent in our Shipping to the Eaſt Countries, will buy there one hundred thouſand Quarters of VVheat, clear aboard the Ships, which being after brought into
<hi>England</hi> and houſed, to Export the ſame at the beſt time for vent thereof in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> it cannot yield leſs in thoſe Parts than two hundred thouſand Pounds to make the Merchant but a Saver; yet by this reckoning, we ſee the Kingdom hath doubled that Treaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Remote Trades are moſt Gainful to the Common-Wealth.</note>2. Again this Profit will be far Greater when we Trade thus in remote Countries, as for Example; if we ſend one hundred thouſand pounds into the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> to buy Pepper there, and bring it hither, and from hence ſend it for <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> it muſt yield ſeven hundred thouſand pounds at leaſt in thoſe Places, in regard of the Exceſſive charge which the Merchant disburſeth in thoſe long Voyages in Shipping, VVages, Victuals, Inſurance, Intereſt, Cuſtoms, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and the like, all which notwithſtanding the King and Kingdom gets.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But where the Voyages are ſhort, and the VVares rich, which therefore will not employ much Shipping, the Profit will be far leſs. As when another hundred thouſand Pounds ſhall be employed in <hi>Turky</hi> in raw Silks, and brought hither to be after Tranſported from hence into
<hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> the Merchant ſhall have good Gain, although he ſell it there but for one hundred and fifty thouſand Pounds: and thus take the Voyages altogether in their
<hi>Medium,</hi> the Monies Exported will be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us more than Trebled. But if any Man will yet object, that theſe returns come to us in VVares, and not really in Mony, as they were iſſued out,</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is, (keeping our firſt Ground) that if our Conſumption of Forein VVares be no more yearly than is already ſuppoſed; and that our Exportations be ſo mightily increaſed by this manner of Trading with ready Mony, as is before declared: It is not then poſſible, but that all the Over ballance or Difference ſhould return either in Mony, or in ſuch Wares as we muſt Export again, which, as is already plainly ſhewed, will be ſtill a greater Means to increaſe our Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98306:245"/>
                     <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith <hi>He that hath Ware, hath Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by the Year.</hi>
                     </note>For it is in the Stock of the Kingdom, as in the Eſtates of Private Men, who having ſtore of Wares, do not therefore ſay, that they will not venture out or Trade with their Mony, (for this were ridiculous) but do alſo turn that into Wares whereby they multiply their Mony; and ſo by a continual and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Change of one into the other, grow Rich, and when they pleaſe turn all their Eſtates into Treaſure; for they that have Wares cannot want Mony.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it ſaid, that Mony is the Life of Trade, as if it could not ſubſiſt without the ſame; for we know that there was great Trading by way of Commutation or Barter, when there was little Mony ſtirring in the World. The <hi>Italians</hi> and ſome other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ſuch remedies againſt this Want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transfer Bills of Debt, and have Banks both Publick and Private, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do aſſign their Credits from one to another daily for very great Sums with Eaſe and Satisfaction, by VVritings only, whilſt, in the mean time, the Maſs of Treaſure which gave foundation to thoſe Credits, is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Forein Trade, as a Merchandize; and by the ſaid means they have little other uſe of Mony in thoſe Countries, more than for their ordinary Expences. It is not therefore the keeping of our Mony in the Kingdom, but the Neceſſity and Uſe of our VVares in Forein Countries, and our want of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that cauſeth the Vent and Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on all ſides, which makes a quick and ample Trade. If we were once Poor, and now having gained ſome ſtore of Mony by Trade, with reſolution to keep it ſtill in the Realm; ſhall this cauſe other Nations to ſpend more of our Commodities than formerly they have done, whereby we might ſay that our Trade is Quickned and Enlarged? No verily, it will produce no ſuch good effect: but rather, according to the alteration of times by their true cauſes, we may expect the contrary; for all Men do conſent that Plenty of Mony in a Kingdom doth make the Native Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties dearer; which, as it is to the Profit of ſome Private Men in their Revenues, ſo is it directly againſt the Benefit of the Publick in the Quantity of the Trade, for as Plenty of Mony makes VVares dearer, ſo dear VVares decline their Uſe and Conſumption, as hath been already plainly ſhewed in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon that particular of our Cloth: And although this is a very hard Leſſon for ſome great landed Men to learn, yet I am ſure it is a true Leſſon for all the Land to obſerve, leſt when we have gained ſome ſtore of Mony by Trade, we looſe it again by not Trading with our Mony. I knew a Prince in
<hi>Italy</hi> (of Famous Memory) <hi>Ferdinando the firſt,</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who being very rich in Treaſure, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith to enlarge his Trade, by iſſuing out to his Merchants great Sums of Mony for very ſmall Profit; I my ſelf had Forty thouſand Crowns of him, <hi>gratis,</hi> for a whole Year, although he knew that I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſend it away in <hi>Specie</hi> for the Parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> to be employed in VVares for his Countries; he being well aſſured, that in this Courſe of Trade it would return again (according to the Old ſaying) with a Duck in the Mouth. This Noble and Induſtrious Prince, by his Care and diligence to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and favour Merchants in their Affairs, did ſo increaſe the Practice thereof, that there is ſcarce a Nobleman or Gentleman in all his Dominions, that doth not Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize either by himſelf, or in Partnerſhip with others; whereby, within theſe thirty Years, the Trade to his Port of <hi>Leghorne</hi> is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that of a poor Little Town, (as I my ſelf knew it) it is now become a Fair and Strong City, being one of the moſt Famous Places for all Chriſtendom. And yet it is worthy our Obſervation, that the multitude of Ships and VVares which come thither from
<hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and other places, have little or no means to make their returns from thence, but only in ready Mony, which they may and do carry away freely at all times, to the incredible Advantage of the ſaid great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and his Subjects, who are much enriched by the continual great concourſe of Merchants from all the States of the Neighbour Princes, bringing them plenty of Mony daily to ſupply their wants of the ſaid Wares. And thus we ſee, that the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Merchandize which carries away their Treaſure, becomes a flowing Stream to fill them again in a greater meaſure with Mony.</p>
                  <p>There is yet an Objection or two as weak as all the reſt: that is, if we Trade with our Mony, we ſhall iſſue out the leſs Wares; as if a Man ſhould ſay, thoſe Countries which heretofore had occaſion to conſume our Cloth, Lead, Iron, Fiſh, and the like, ſhall now make uſe of our Monies in the place of thoſe Neceſſaries which were moſt abſurd to affirm, or that the Merchant had not rather carry out Wares by which there is ever ſome gains expected, than to Export Mony which is ſtill but the ſame without any increaſe.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, there are many Countries which may yield us very profitable Trade for our Mony, which otherwiſe afford us no Trade at all, becauſe they have no uſe of our Wares, as namely the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for one in the firſt beginning thereof, although ſince by induſtry in our Commerce with thoſe Nations, we have brought them into the uſe of much of our Lead, Cloth, Tin, and other things, which is a good Addition to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vent of our Commodities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98306:246"/>Again, ſome Men have alleged, that thoſe Countries which permit Mony to be carried out, do it becauſe they have few or no VVares to Trade withal: but we have great ſtore of Commodities, and therefore their Action ought not to be our Example.</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is briefly, that we have ſuch a quantity of VVares as doth fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide us of all things needful from beyond the Seas; why ſhould we then doubt that out Monies ſent out in Trade, muſt not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come back again in Treaſure; together with the great Gains which it may procure in ſuch manner as is before ſet down? And on the other ſide, if thoſe Nations which ſend out their Monies, do it becauſe they have but few VVares of their own, how come they then to have ſo much Treaſure, as we ever ſee in thoſe Places which ſuffer it freely to be Exported at all times, and by whomſoever? I anſwer, <hi>Even by Trading with their Monies;</hi> for by what other means can they get it, having no Mines of Gold or Silver?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought eſpecially to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their ends</note>Thus may we plainly ſee, that when this weighty Buſineſs is duly conſidered in its end, as all our Humane Actions ought well to be weighed, it is found much contrary to that which moſt Men eſteem thereof, becauſe they ſearch no further than the beginning of the VVork, which miſsinforms their Judgments, and leads them into Error: For if we behold the Actions of the Husbandman in the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time when he caſteth away much good Corn into the Ground, we will rather account him a Madman than a Husbandman: but when we conſider his Labours in the Harveſt, which is the end of his Endeavours, we find the VVorth and Plentiful Increaſe of his actions.</p>

                  <p>IT is a common ſaying, That <hi>Plenty or Scarcity of Mony makes all things Dear, or Good, or Cheap;</hi> and this Mony is either gotten or loſt in Forein Trade, by the over or underballancing of the ſame, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed. It reſteth now that I diſtinguiſh the ſeeming Plenties of Mony from that which is only ſubſtantial and able to perform the VVork: For there are divers VVays and Means whereby to procure plenty of Mony into a Kingdom, which do not Enrich, but rather Empoveriſh the ſame, by the ſeveral Inconveniencies which ever accompany ſuch Alterations.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, if we melt down our Plate into Coin (which ſuits not with the Majeſty of ſo great a Kingdom, except in caſes of great Extremity) it would cauſe Plenty of Mony for a time, yet ſhould we be nothing the Richer, but rather this Treaſure being thus altered is made the more apt to be carried out of the Kingdom, if we exceed our means by exceſs in Forein Wares, or maintain a War by Sea or Land, where we do not Feed and Cloath the Soldiers, and ſupply the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with our own Native Proviſions, by which diſorders our Treaſure will ſoon be exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we think to bring in ſtore of Mony by ſuffering Forein Coins to paſs current at higher rates than their intrinſick value, compared with our Standard, or by debaſing or enhancing our own Monies; all theſe have their ſeveral Inconveniences and Difficulties, (which hereafter I will declare) but admitting that by this means plenty of Mony might be brought into the Realm, yet ſhould we be nothing the Richer; neither can ſuch Treaſure ſo gotten long remain with us. For if the Stranger or the Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bring in this Mony, it muſt be done upon a valuable Conſideration, either for Wares carried out already, or after to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, which helps us nothing, except the Evil occaſions of exceſs or VVar afore-named be removed, which do exhauſt our Treaſure: for otherwiſe, what one Man bringeth for Gain, another Man ſhall be forced to carry out for neceſſity; becauſe there ſhall ever be a Neceſſity to ballance our Accounts with Strangers, although it ſhould be done with loſs upon the rate of the Mony, and Confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation alſo if it be intercepted by the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How we muſt get Treaſure to make it our own</note>The Concluſion of this Buſineſs is briefly thus: That as the Treaſure which is brought into the Realm by the Ballance of our Forein Trade, is that Mony which only doth abide with us, and by which we are enriched: ſo by this Plenty of Mony thus gotten (and no otherwiſe) do our Lands improve. For when the Merchant hath a good diſpatch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas for his Cloth and other VVares, he doth preſently return to buy up the greater Quantity, which raiſeth the Price of our VVools and other Commodities, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth improve the Landlords Rents as the Leaſes expire daily: And alſo by this means Mony being gained, and brought more abundantly into the Kingdom, it doth enable many Men to buy Lands, which will make them the Dearer. But if our Forein Trade come to a Stop or Declination by neglect at home, or injuries abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoveriſhed, and thereby the VVares of the Realm leſs iſſued, then do all the ſaid Benefits ceaſe, and our Lands fall of Price daily.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. The Spaniſh Treaſure cannot be kept from other Kingdoms by any Prohibition made in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALL the Mines of Gold and Silver, which are as yet diſcovered in the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Places of the World, are not of ſo great Value as thoſe of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> which are in the Poſſeſſion of the King of
<hi>Spain:</hi> Who thereby is enabled not only to keep in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection many goodly States and Provinces in <hi>Italy</hi> and elſewhere, (which otherwiſe would ſoon fall from his Obeiſance,) but alſo by a continual War, taking his Advantages, doth ſtill enlarge his Dominions, ambitiouſly aiming at a Monarchy by the Power of his Monies, which are the very Sinews of his Strength, that lies ſo far diſperſed into ſo many Countries, yet hereby united, and his Wants ſupplied both for War and Peace in a plentiful manner from all the parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, which are therefore Partakers of his Treaſure by a Neceſſity of Commerce; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Policy hath ever endeavoured to prevent all other Nations the moſt it could:
<note place="margin">The Policy and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Spain</hi> by the Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                     </note>For finding <hi>Spain</hi> to be poor and barren to ſupply itſelf and the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with thoſe Varieties of Forein Wares, whereof they ſtand in need, they knew well that when their Native Commodities come ſhort to this purpoſe, their Monies muſt ſerve to make up the reckoning; whereupon they found an incredible Advantage to add the Traffick of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> to the Treaſure of the <hi>Weſt:</hi> For the laſt of theſe being employ'd in the firſt, they ſtored themſelves infinitely with rich Wares to barter with all the parts of Chriſtendom for their Commodities, and ſo furniſhing their own Neceſſities, prevented others for carrying away their Monies: Which in Point of State they hold leſs dangerous to impart to the remote
<hi>Indians,</hi> than to their Neighbour Princes, leſt it ſhould too much enable them to reſiſt (if not offend) their Enemies. And this
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Policy againſt others is the more remarkable, being done likewiſe ſo much to their own Advantage; for every Ryal of Eight which they ſent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> brought home ſo much Wares as ſaved them the disburſing of five Ryals of Eight here in <hi>Europe,</hi> (at leaſt) to their Neighbours, eſpecially in thoſe times when that Trade was only in their hands: but now this great Profit is failed, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief removed by the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and others which partake in thoſe
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trades, as ample as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be conſidered, that beſides the Diſability of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commodities to provide Forein Wares for their Neceſſities, whereby they are forced to ſupply the want with Mony, they have likewiſe that Canker of War, which doth infinitely exhauſt their Treaſure, and diſperſe it into Chriſtendom even to their Enemies, part by Repriſal, but eſpecially through a neceſſary Maintenance of thoſe Armies which are compoſed of Strangers, and lie ſo far remote that they cannot feed, cloth, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provide for them out of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Means and Proviſions, but muſt receive this Relief from other Nations:
<note place="margin">The effects of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Wars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note>Which kind of War is far different to that which a Prince maketh upon his own Confines, or in his Navies by Sea, where the Soldier receiving Mony for his Wages, muſt every day deliver it out again for his Neceſſities, whereby the Treaſure remains ſtill in the Kingdom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be exhauſted from the King: But we ſee that the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> (truſting in the Power of his Treaſure,) undertakes VVars in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in other remote Places, which would ſoon begger the richeſt Kingdom in Chriſtendom of all their Mony; the want whereof would preſently diſorder and bring the Armies to Confuſion, as it falleth out ſometimes with <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, who have the Fountain of Mony, when either it is ſtopp'd in the Paſſage by the force of their Enemies, or drawn out faſter than it flows by their own Occaſions; whereby alſo we often ſee, that Gold and ſilver is often ſo ſcant in <hi>Spain,</hi> that they are forced to uſe baſe Copper mony, to the great Confuſion of their Trade, and not without the undoing alſo of many of their own People.</p>
                  <p>But now, that we have ſeen the Occaſions by which the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaſure is diſperſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many places of the VVorld, let us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcover how, and in what Proportion, each Country doth enjoy theſe Monies, for we find that <hi>Turky,</hi> and divers other Nations, have great plenty thereof, although they drive no Trade with
<hi>Spain,</hi> which ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the former Reaſon, where we ſay that this Treaſure is obtained by a Neceſſity of Commerce. But to clear this point, we muſt know, that all Nations (who have no Mines of their own,) are enriched with Gold and Silver by one and the ſame means, which is already ſhewed to be the Ballance of their Forein Trade: And this is not ſtrictly ty'd to be done in thoſe Countries where the Fountain of Treaſure is, but rather with ſuch Order and Obſervations as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For ſuppoſe <hi>England,</hi> by Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> may gain and bring home Five Hundred Thouſand Ryals of Eight yearly; if we loſe as much by our Trade in <hi>Turky,</hi> and therefore carry the Mony thither, it is not then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> which have got this Treaſure, although they have no Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> from whence it was firſt brought. Again, if <hi>England,</hi> having
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98306:247"/>thus loſt with <hi>Turky,</hi> do notwithſtanding gain twice as much by <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and other Members of her general Trade, then will there remain Five Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ryals of Eight clear Gains by the Ballance of this Trade: And this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds between all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is yearly gotten.</p>
                  <p>But if yet a Queſtion ſhould be made, whether all Nations get Treaſure and <hi>Spain</hi> only loſe it? I anſwer, No; for ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by VVar, or by Exceſs, do loſe that which they had gotten, as well as <hi>Spain</hi> by VVar and want of VVares doth loſe that which was its own.</p>

               <div n="7" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. VII. The Diverſity of Gain by Forein Trade.</head>
                  <p>IN the courſe of Forein Trade there are three ſorts of Gain, the firſt is that of the Common-wealth, which may be done when the Merchant, (who is the Principal Agent therein,) ſhall loſe. The ſecond is the Gain of the Merchant, which he doth ſometimes juſtly and worthily effect, although the Common-wealth be a loſer. The third is the Gain of the King, whereof he is ever certain, even when the Common-wealth and the Merchant ſhall be both lofers.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently ſhewed the Ways and Means whereby a Common-wealth may be Enriched in the courſe of Trade; whereof it is needleſs here to make any repetition, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I do in this Place affirm, that ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be in the Common-wealth, when the Merchant in his particular ſhall have no occaſion to rejoice. As for Example, ſuppoſe the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſend out one hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thouſand Pounds into the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and receive home for the ſame the full value of three hundred thouſand Pounds; Hereby it is evident, that this Part of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is trebled, and yet I may boldly ſay that which I can well prove, that the ſaid Company of Merchants ſhall loſe at leaſt Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Pounds by ſuch an adventure, if the returns be made in <hi>Spice, Indico, Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes, Benjamin, Refined Saltpeter,</hi> and ſuch other bulky Wares in their ſeveral Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to their Vent and Uſe in theſe parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> For the Freight of Shipping, the Inſurance of this Adventure, the Charges of Factors abroad, and Officers at home; the Forbearance of the Stock, His Majeſties Cuſtoms and Impoſts, with other petty Charges incident, cannot be leſs than two hundred and fifty thouſand Pounds, which being added to the Principal, produceth the ſaid Loſs. And thus we ſee, that not only the Kingdom, but alſo the King by his Cuſtoms and Impoſts may get notoriouſly, even when the Merchant notwithſtanding, ſhall loſe grievouſly; which giveth us good occaſion here to conſider, how much more the Realm is enriched by this noble Trade; when all things paſs ſo happily, that the Merchant is a Gainer alſo with the King and Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I affirm, that a Merchant: by his laudable endeavours, may both carry out and bring in VVares to his Advantage, by Selling and Buying them to good Profit, which is the end of his Labours; when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the Common-wealth ſhall decline and grow Poor by a Diſorder in the People, when through Pride and other Exceſſes, they do conſume more Forein VVares in value than the Wealth of the Kingdom can ſatisfie and pay by the Exportation of our own Commodities, which is the very Quality of an Unthrift who ſpends beyond his Means.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the King is ever ſure to get by Trade, when both the Common-wealth and Merchant ſhall loſe ſeverally as afore-written, or jointly, as it may and doth ſometimes happen, when at one and the ſame time our Commodities are over-ballanced by Forein Wares conſumed, and that the Merchant's ſucceſs prove no better than is before declared.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt not take the King's Gain in this large ſenſe, for ſo we might ſay that his Majeſty ſhould get, although half the Trade of the Kingdom were loſt; we ſhall rather ſuppoſe that whereas the whole Trade of the Realm of Exportations and Importations, is now found for to be about the Yearly value of Four Millions and a half of Pounds; it may be yet increaſed Two hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> more by the Importation and Conſumption of Forein Wares. By this means we know that the King ſhall be a Gainer near Twenty thouſand pounds, but the Common-wealth ſhall loſe the whole Two hundred thouſand Pounds thus ſpent in Exceſs. And the Merchant may be a Loſer alſo when the Trade ſhall in this manner be increaſed to the Profit of the King; who, notwithſtanding, ſhall be ſure in the end to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Loſs, if he prevent not ſuch Unthrifty Courſes as do impoveriſh his Subjects.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. The Enhancing or Debaſing our Monies, cannot Enrich the Kingdom with Treaſure, nor hinder the Exportation thereof.</head>
                  <p>THere are three ways by which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a Kingdom are commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. The firſt is, when the Coins in their ſeveral Denominations are made cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at more or leſs Pounds, Shillings, or Pence, than formerly. The ſecond is, when the ſaid Coins are altered in their Weight, and yet continue currant at the former Rates. The third is, when the Standard is either Debaſed or Enriched in the Fineneſs of the Gold and Silver, yet the Monies continue in their former Values.</p>
                  <p>In all occaſions of want or plenty of Mony in the Kingdom, we do ever find divers Men, who uſing their Wits for a Remedy to ſupply the Firſt and preſerve the Laſt, they fall preſently upon altering the Monies; for, ſay they, the raiſing of the Coins in value, will cauſe it to be brought into the Realm from divers Places, in hope of the Gain; and the Debaſing of the Monies in the Fineneſs or Weight will keep it here for fear of the Loſs. But theſe Men pleaſing themſelves with the beginning only of this weighty Buſineſs, conſider not the Progreſs and End thereof, whereunto we ought eſpecially to direct our Thoughts and Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for
<hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </note>For we muſt know, that Mony is not only the true meaſure of all our other means in the Kingdom, but alſo of our Forein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Strangers, which therefore ought to be kept Juſt and Conſtant, to avoid thoſe Confuſions which ever accompany ſuch alterations. For firſt, at Home, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Meaſure be changed, our Lands, Leaſes, Wares, both Forein and Domeſtick, muſt alter in proportion: And although this is not done without much Trouble and Damage alſo to ſome Men, yet in ſhort time this muſt neceſſarily come to paſs; for that is not the Denomination of our Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, which is reſpected, but the intrinſick value of our Coins; unto which we have little reaſon to add any further Eſtimation or Worth, if it lay in our power to do it, for this would be a ſpecial Service to <hi>Spain,</hi> and an act againſt our ſelves to indear the Commodity of another Prince.
<note place="margin">Mony is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our other means.</note>Neither can theſe courſes which ſo much hurt the Subjects, any way help the King, as ſome Men have imagined: for although the Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or Lightning of all our Mony ſhould bring a preſent Benefit (for once only) to the Mint, yet all this and more would ſoon be loſt again in the future great Incoms of His Majeſty, when by this means they muſt be paid yearly with Mony of leſs intrinſick value than formerly: Nor can it be ſaid, that the whole Loſs of the Kingdom would be the Profit of the King, they differ infinitely: for all Mens Eſtates, (be it Leaſes, Lands, Debts, Wares, or Mony) muſt ſuffer in their Proportions, whereas His Majeſty ſhould have the Gain only upon ſo much ready Mony as might be new Coined, which, in compariſon, would prove a very ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<note place="margin">All the ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this Kingdom is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than one Million of Pounds.</note>for although they who have other Eſtates in Mony, are ſaid to be a great Number, and to be worth Five or Ten thouſand Pound <hi>per</hi> Man, more or leſs, which amounts to many millions in all; yet are they not poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereof all together, or at once; for it were Vanity and againſt their Profit to keep continually in their hands above Forty or Fifty Pounds in a Family to defray neceſſary Charges, the reſt muſt ever run from Man to Man in Traffick, for their Benefit, whereby we may conceive, that a little Mony (being made the meaſure of all our other means) doth Rule and Diſtribute great matters daily to all Men in their juſt Proportion: And we muſt know likewiſe, that much of our old Mony is worn light, and therefore would yield little or no profit at the Mint, and the Gain upon the Heavy, would cauſe our vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Neighbours to carry over a great Part thereof, and return it preſently in pieces of the New Stamp; nor do we doubt that ſome of our own Country-men would turn Coiners, and venture a Hanging for this Profit; ſo that His Majeſty in the end ſhould get little by ſuch Alterations.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but ſay ſome Men, If His Majeſty raiſe the Mony, great ſtore of Treaſure would alſo be brought into the Mint from Forein Parts, for we have ſeen by Experience, that the late raiſing of our Gold ten in the Hundred, did bring in great ſtore thereof, more than we were accuſtomed to have in the Kingdom; the which as I cannot deny, ſo do I likewiſe affirm, that this Gold carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away all or the moſt part of our Silver, (which was not over-worn or too light) as we may eaſily perceive by the preſent uſe of our Monies in their reſpective qualities: And the Reaſon of this Change is, becauſe our Silver was not raiſed in proportion with our Gold which ſtill giveth advantage to the Merchant, to bring in the Kingdom's Yearly Gain by Trade in Gold rather than in Silver.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we be inconſtant in our Coins and and thereby violate the Laws of Forein Commerce; other Princes are vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in theſe Caſes, to alter preſently in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with us, and then where is our hope? Or if they do not alter, what can we hope for? For if the Stranger-merchant bring in his Wares, and find that our Monies are raiſed, ſhall not he likewiſe keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98306:248"/>until he may ſell them dearer? And ſhall not the Price of the Merchant's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with Forein Countries, riſe in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with our Monies? All which being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, why may not our Monies be carried out of the Kingdom as well, and to as much profit, after the raiſing thereof, as before the Alteration?</p>
                  <p>But peradventure ſome Men will yet ſay, that if our Monies be raiſed, and other Countries raiſe not, it will cauſe more Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin and Forein Coins to be brought in than heretofore. If this be done, it muſt be performed either by the Merchant who hath exported Wares, or by the Merchant who intends to buy off our Commodities: And it is manifeſt that neither of theſe can have more Advantage or Benefit by this Art now, than they might have had before the Alteration of the Mony. For if their ſaid Bulloin and Forein Coins be more worth than formerly in our Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, yet what ſhall they get by that, when theſe Monies are Baſer or Lighter, and that therefore they are riſen in Proportion? So we may plainly ſee, that theſe innovations are no good means to bring Treaſure into the Kingdom, nor yet to keep it here when we have it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. A Toleration for Forein Coins to paſs currant here at higher Rates than their Value with our Standard, will not encreaſe our Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Merchants do or ought to know the Weight and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Forein Coins.</note>THE diſcreet Merchant for the better directing of his Trade, and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes by Bills to and from the ſeveral Places of the World where he is accuſtomed to deal, doth carefully learn the Parity or equal Value of the Monies according to their Weight and Fineneſs compared with our Standard, whereby he is able to know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the juſt Profit or Loſs of his Affairs. And I make no doubt, but that we Trade to divers places where we vent off our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Commodities yearly, to a great Value, and yet find few or no Wares there fitting our uſe, whereby we are enforced to make our returns in ready Mony, which by us is either carried into ſome other Countries to be converted into Wares which we want, or elſe it is brought into the Realm <hi>in Specie;</hi> which being tolerated to paſs currant here in Payment, at higher rates than they are worth to be Coined into Sterling Mony; that ſeemeth very probable that the greater Quantity will be brought in: but when all the Circumſtances are duly conſidered, this Courſe likewiſe will be found as weak as the reſt to increaſe our Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Toleration itſelf doth break the Laws of entercourſe, and would ſoon move other Princes to perform the ſame acts, or worſe, againſt us. And ſo fruſtrate our hopes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Mony be the true Meaſure of all other means, and Forein Coins tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to paſs current amongſt us, at higher rates than they are worth (being compared with our Standard) it followeth, that the Common-wealth ſhall not be juſtly diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when that paſſeth by a falſe Meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the Advantage between ours and Forein Coins be but ſmall, that will bring in little or no Treaſure, becauſe the Merchant will rather bring in Wares upon which there is uſually a competent Gain. And on the other ſide, if we permit a great Advantage to the Forein Coins, then that Gain will carry away all our Sterling Mony; and ſo I leave this Buſineſs in a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and fruitleſs, as all other courſes will ever prove, which ſeek for the Gain or Loſs of our Treaſure, out of the Ballance of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Forein Trade, as I will endeavour yet further to demonſtrate.</p>

                  <p>There are three ways by which a Merchant make the returns of his Wares from beyond the Seas, that is to ſay in Mony, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, or by Exchange. But the Statute of Employment doth not only reſtrain Mony, (in which there is a ſeeming Providence and Juſtice) but alſo the Uſe of the Exchange by Bills, which doth violate the Law of Commerce, and is indeed an Act without Example in any place of the World where we have Trade, and therefore to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that whatſoever (in this kind) we ſhall impoſe upon Strangers here, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be made a Law for us in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, eſpecially where we have our greateſt Trade with our vigilant Neighbours, who omit no care nor occaſion to ſupport their Traffick in equal Privileges with other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And thus in the firſt place, we ſhould be deprived of that Freedom and Means which now we have to bring Treaſure into the Kingdom, and therewith likewiſe we ſhould loſe the Vent of much Wares, which we carry to divers places, whereby our Trade and our Treaſure would decay together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If by the ſaid Statute we thruſt the Exportation of our Wares (more than ordinary) upon the Stranger, we muſt then take it from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which were injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our Merchants, Mariners, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; beſides the hurt to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in venting the Kingdom's Stock to the Stranger, at far lower rates here, than we muſt do if we ſold it to them in their own Countries, as is proved in the third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas we have already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhewed, that if our Commodities be over-ballanced in value by Forein Wares, our Mony muſt be carried out. How is it poſſible to prevent this by tying the Stranger's hands, and leaving the Engliſh looſe? Shall not the ſame Reaſons and Advantage cauſe that to be done by them now, that was done by the other before? Or if we make a Statute (without example) to prevent both alike, ſhall we not then overthrow all at once? The King in his Cuoſtms, and the Kingdom in her Profits; for ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction muſt of neceſſity deſtroy much Trade, becauſe the diverſity of Occaſions and Places, which make an ample Trade, require that ſome Men ſhould both Export and Import Wares; ſome Export only, others Import; ſome deliver our their Monies by Exchange, others take it up; ſome carry out Mony, others bring it in, and this in a greater or leſſer Quantity, according to the good Husbandry or Exceſs in the Kingdom, over which only if we keep a ſtrict Law, it will rule all the reſt, and without this all other Statutes are no Rules either to keep or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To leave no Objection unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it ſhould be ſaid, that a Statute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Engliſh as well as the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, muſt needs keep our Mony in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: What ſhall we get by this, if it hinder the coming in of Mony by the decay of that ample Trade which we enjoyed in the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thereof? Is not the Remedy far worſe than the Diſeaſe? Shall we not live more like Iriſhmen than Engliſhmen, when the King's Revenues, our Merchants, Mariners, Shipping, Arts, Lands, Riches, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay together with our Trade?</p>
                  <p>Yea, but ſay ſome Men, we have better hopes than ſo; for the Intent of the Statute is, that as all the Forein Wares which are brought in ſhall be employed in our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, thereby to keep our Mony in the Kingdom: So we doubt not but to ſend out a ſufficient Quantity of our own Wares over and above, to bring in the Value thereof in ready Mony.</p>
                  <p>Although this is abſolutely denied by the Reaſons afore-written, yet now we will grant it, becauſe we deſire to end the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: For if this be true, that other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vent more of our Commodites, than we conſume of theirs in value, then I affirm, that the over-plus muſt neceſſarily return unto us in Treaſure, without the Uſe of the Statute, which is therefore not only fruitleſs but hurtful, as ſome other like reſtrictions are found to be when they are fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. It will not increaſe our Treaſure to enjoyn the Merchant that exporteth Fiſh, Corn, or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to return all or part of the Value in Mony.</head>
                  <p>VIctuals and Munition for War, are ſo precious in a Common-Wealth, that either it ſeemeth neceſſary to reſtrain the Exportation altogether, or (if the Plenty permits it) to require the return thereof in ſo much Treaſure; which appeareth to be reaſonable and without difficulty, becauſe<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98306:249"/>
                     <hi>Spain</hi> and other Countries do willingly part with their Mony for ſuch Wares, although in other occaſions of Trade they ſtraightly prohibit the Exportation thereof: All which I grant to be true; yet notwithſtanding, we muſt conſider that all the Ways and Means which (in courſe of Trade) force Treaſure into the Kingdom, do not therefore make it ours; for this can be done only by a Lawful Gain, and this Gain is no way to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed but by the Over-ballance of our Trade, and this Over-ballance is made leſs by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions:
<note place="margin">Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions hinder Trade.</note>Therefore ſuch Reſtrictions do hinder the Increaſe of our Treaſure. The Argument is plain, and needs no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſtrengthen it, except any Man be ſo vain to think that Reſtrictions would not cauſe the leſs Wares to be exported. But if this likewiſe ſhould be granted, yet to enjoyn the Merchant to bring in Mony for Victuals and Munition carried out, will not cauſe us to have one Peny the more in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at the Years end; For whatſoever is forced in one way, muſt out again in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: becauſe only ſo much will remain and abide with us, as is Gained and Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the Eſtate of the Kingdom by the Over-ballance of the Trade.</p>
                  <p>This may be made plain by an example taken from an Engliſhman, who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to buy and conſume the Wares of divers of Strangers for the Value of one thouſand Pounds, he ſold them to the ſaid Strangers, and preſently forced all the Mony from them, there remained only four hundred Pounds to the ſaid Engliſhman, for Over-ballance of the Wares bought and ſold; ſo the reſt which he had received was returned back from whence he forced it. And this ſhall ſuffice to ſhew, that whatſoever courſes we take to force Mony into the Kingdom, yet ſo much only will remain with us as we ſhall gain by the Ballance of our Trade.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndervaluing of our Mony which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or received by Bills of Exchange here or beyond the Seas, cannot decreaſe our Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>THE Merchants Exchange by Bills, is a Means and Practice whereby they that have Mony in one Country, may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame to receive that again in another Country, at certain Times and Rates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, whereby the Lender and the Borrower are accommodated without tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting of Treaſure from State to State.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Exchanges thus made between Man and Man, are not contracted at the equal value of the Monies, according to their reſpective Weights and Fineneſs: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that delivereth his Mony, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Venture of the Debt, and the time of Forbearance; but that which cauſeth an under or over-valuing of Monies by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, is the Plenty or Scarcity thereof in thoſe Places where the Exchanges are made. For Example, when here is plenty of Mony to be delivered for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then ſhall our Mony be under-valued in Exchange, becauſe they who take up the Mony, ſeeing it ſo plentifully thruſt upon them, do thereby make advantage to themſelves, in taking the ſame at an undervalue.</p>
                  <p>And contrarywiſe, when here is Scarcity of Mony to be delivered for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the Deliverer will make the ſame Advantage, by over-valuing our Mony which he delivereth.
<note place="margin">Plenty of Mony makes the Exchange cheap, and all other things dear.</note>And thus we ſee, that as Plenty or Scarcity of Mony in a Common-wealth doth make all Good, things Dear or Cheap; ſo in the Courſe of Exchange it hath ever a contrary Working; wherefore in the next Place, it is fit to ſet down the true Cauſes of this Effect.</p>
                  <p>As Plenty or Scarcity of Mony do make the Price of the Exchange high or low, ſo the Over or Under-ballance of our Trade doth effectually cauſe the Plenty or Scarcity of Mony: And here we muſt underſtand, that the Ballance of our Trade is either General or Particular. The General is, when all our yearly Traffick is jointly valued, as I have formerly ſhewed; the Particular is when our Trade to <hi>Italy, France, Turky, Spain,</hi> and other Countries are ſeverally conſidered; and by this latter Courſe we ſhall perfectly find out the Places where our Mony is under or over-valued in Exchange: For although our general Exportations of Wares may be yearly more in value than that which is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, whereby the difference is made good to us in ſo much Treaſure; nevertheleſs, the Particular Trades do work diverſly: For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> may bring us more in value than we ſell them, which if it be ſo, then do the
<hi>Low-Country</hi> Merchants not only carry away our Treaſure to ballance the Accompt between us, but alſo by this means Mony being plentiful here to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Exchange;
<note place="margin">What kinds of Plenty or Scarcity of Mony make the Exchange high or low.</note>it is therefore under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued by the Takers as I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and contrary wiſe, if we carry more Wares to
<hi>Spain,</hi> and other Places, than we conſume of theirs, then do we bring away their Treaſure, and likewiſe in the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Exchange we over-value our own Mony.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſtill there are ſome who will ſeem to make this Plain by Demonſtration, that the Under-valuing of our Mony by Exchange, doth carry it out of the Kingdom: For ſay they, we ſee daily great ſtore of our Engliſh Coins carried over, which paſs current in the Low-Countries, and there is great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98306:249"/>to carry them thither, to ſave the Loſs which the Low-Country-men have in the Exchange; for if one Hundred Pounds ſterling delivered here, is ſo much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, that Ninety Pounds of the ſame Sterling Mony, carried over <hi>in Specie,</hi> ſhall be ſufficient to make repayment and full Satisfaction of the ſaid hundred Pounds at <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> Is it not then (ſay they) the Undervaluing of our Mony which cauſeth it to be carried out of the Realm?</p>
                  <p>To this Objection I will make a full and plain Anſwer, ſhewing, that it is not the Undervaluing of our Mony in Exchange, but the Over-ballancing of our Trade that carrieth away our Treaſure. For ſuppoſe that our whole Trade with the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for Wares brought into this Realm, be performed only by the <hi>Dutch</hi> for the Value of Five hundred thouſand Pounds yearly; and that all our Commodities tranſported into the ſaid Low-Countries be performed only by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for Four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds yearly. Is it not then manifeſt, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> can Exchange only four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thouſand Pounds with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> or equal value of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Standards? So the other Hundred thouſand Pounds which is the Over-ballance of the Trade, they muſt of neceſſity carry that away in Mony. And the ſelf-ſame Loſs of Treaſure muſt happen, if there were no Exchange at all permitted; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> carrying away our Mony for their Wares, and we bringing in their Forein Coins for their Commodities, there will be ſtill one hundred thouſand Pounds loſs.</p>
                  <p>Now let us add another Example, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the aforeſaid proportion of Trade between us and the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The
<hi>Dutch</hi> (as afore written) may Exchange with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for
400000 Pounds and no more, upon the equal Value of the Monies, becauſe the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> have no further means to ſatisfie. But now, Suppoſe that in reſpect of the Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mony, which in this Caſe will be here in the hands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to deliver by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Mony in Exchange is the Strangers Loſs and our Gain.</note>our Mony (according to that which hath been already ſaid) will be under-valued Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> then is it manifeſt, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> muſt deliver Four hundred and forty thouſand Pounds to have the <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thouſand Pounds in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> ſo that there will then remain but
60000 Pounds for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to carry out of the Realm, to ballance the Accompt between them and us. Whereby we may plainly perceive that the Undervaluing of our Mony in Exchange, will not carry it out of the Kingdom, as ſome Men have ſuppoſed; but rather is a Means to make a leſs Quantity thereof to be Exported, than would be done at the <hi>Par pro Pari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, Let us ſuppoſe that the Engliſh, Merchant carried out as much Wares in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as the Dutch Merchant bringeth in, whereby the Means is equal between them to make their returns by Exchange, without carrying away of any Mony to the Prejudice of either State. And yet notwithſtanding, the Dutch Merchant for his occaſions or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will forſake this Courſe of Exchange, and will venture to ſend part of his Returns in ready Mony.</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is, that hereupon it muſt follow of Neceſſity, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhall want juſt ſo much means in Exchange with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who therefore ſhall be forced to bring in the like Sum of Mony from beyond the Seas, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> carried out of this Realm; ſo that we may plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Monies which are carried from us within the Ballance of our Trade are not conſiderable, for they do return to us again; and we loſe thoſe Monies only which are made of the Over-ballance of our general Trade: That is to ſay, That which we ſpend more in value in Forein Wares, than we utter of our own Commodities. And the contrary of this, is the only means by which we get our Treaſure.

                  <p>THere are certain Merchants which deal only upon all advantages in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and neither Export nor Import Wares into the Kingdom, which hath cauſed ſome Men to affirm, that the Mony which ſuch meer Exchangers bring in or carry out of the Realm, is not comprehended in the Ballance of our Forein Trade; for (ſay they) ſometimes when our Sterling Mony hath been undervalued, and delivered here for <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>

                  <p>If I had a Deſire to amplifie in the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe VVonders, they would afford me Matter enough to make a large Volume, but my intent is to do it as briefly as poſſibly I may without obſcurity. And before I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, I cannot chooſe but Laugh to think how a worthy Lawyer might be dejected in his laudable Studies, when he ſhould ſee more cunning in
<hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi> by a little Part of the Merchant's Profeſſion, than in all the Law-Caſes of his Learned Authors; For this Exchange goes beyond
<hi>Conjuring;</hi> I think verily, that neither Doctor <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> nor
<hi>Banks</hi> his Horſe, could ever do ſuch admirable Feats, although it is ſure they had a Devil to help them; but we Merchants deal not with ſuch Spirits, we delight not to be thought the VVorkers of Lying VVon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and therefore I endeavour here to ſhew the Plainneſs of our Dealing (in theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Feats) to be agreeable to the Laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Courſe of Trade.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>To lay our Mony with gain, to any place of the World where Exchange lieth.</hi> How can this be done (will ſome Men ſay) for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> when the Loſs by Exchange is ſometimes Eight or Ten <hi>per Cent.</hi> more or leſs for one Month's uſance? The anſwer is, That here I muſt conſider,
<note place="margin">The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of Loſs by Exchange</note>Firſt, that the Principal efficient Cauſe of this Loſs, is a greater Value in VVares brought from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> than we carry thither, which make more Deliverers than Takers here by Exchange, whereby the Mony is underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, to the Benefit of the Taker: Hereupon the Deliverer, rather than he will loſe by his Mony, doth conſider thoſe Countries, unto which we carry more VVares in value than we receive from them; as namely,
<hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and others; to which Places he is ſure (for the Reaſons aforeſaid) that he ſhall ever deliver his Mony with Profit. But now you will ſay, that the Mony is further from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> than before; How ſhall it be got together? Yes, well enough; and the farther about will prove the neareſt VVay home, if it come at laſt with good Profit; the firſt Part whereof being made (as we have ſuppoſed) in <hi>Spain,</hi> from thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where to make my ſecond Gain; and finding that the
<hi>Florentines</hi> ſend out a greater Value in Cloth of Gold and Silver, wrought Silks, and Raſhes to <hi>Spain,</hi> than they receive in Fleece VVools, <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Hides, Sugar and Cochineal, I know I cannot miſs of my purpoſe, by delivering my Mony for <hi>Florence;</hi> where (ſtill upon the ſame Ground) I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my courſe from thence to
<hi>Venice,</hi> and there find that my next Benefit muſt be at
<hi>Franckfort</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> until at laſt I come to
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> by a ſhorter or longer Courſe, according to ſuch occaſions of advantage as the Times and Places ſhall afford me. And thus we ſee ſtill, that the Profit and Loſs upon the Exchange, is guided and ruled by by the Over or Under-ballance of the ſeveral Trades which are Predominant and Active, making the Price of Exchange high or low, which is therefore Paſſive, the contrary whereof is ſo often repeated by the ſaid <hi>Malines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Second, Fourth, Fourteenth, and Twenty Third, I ſay, that all theſe are the proper VVorks of the meer Exchanger, and that his Actions cannot work to the Good or Hurt of the Common wealth, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently ſhewed in the laſt Chapter, and therefore here I may ſpare that labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98306:251"/>To the Third, It is true, I can deliver one Thouſand Pounds here by Exchange, to receive the Value in <hi>Spain,</hi> where with this Spaniſh Mony I can buy and bring away ſo much Spaniſh Wares. But all this doth not prove, but that in the End the Engliſh Mony or Commodities muſt pay for the ſaid Wares: For if I deliver my Thouſand Pounds here to an Engliſh-man, he muſt pay me in <hi>Spain,</hi> either by Goods already ſent, or to be ſent thither; or if I deliver it here to a Spaniard, he takes it of me, with intent to employ it in our Wares; ſo that every way we muſt pay the Stranger for what we have from him: Is there any Feats in all this worthy our admiration?</p>
                  <p>To the Fifth, Thirteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty Firſt. I muſt anſwer theſe Wonders by heaps, where I find them to be all one Matter in divers Forms; and ſuch froth alſo, that every Idiot knows them, and can ſay, that he who hath credit can Contract, Buy, Sell, and take up much Mony by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which he may do as well alſo at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: yet in theſe Courſes they are not always gainers, for ſometimes they live by the Loſs, as well as they who have leſs credit.</p>
                  <p>To the Sixth and Seventh. Here is more poor ſtuff; for when I know the currant Price of my Wares, both here and beyond the Seas, I may eaſily conjecture whether the Profit of the Exchange, of the Gain which I expect upon my Wares will be greater. And again, as every Merchant knows well what he gains upon the Wares he Buyeth and Selleth; ſo may any other Man do the like, that can tell how the ſaid Merchant hath proceeded: But what is all this to make us admire the Exchange?</p>
                  <p>To the Eighth and Twelfth. As Bankers and Exchangers do furniſh Men with Mony for their occaſions, ſo do they likewiſe who let out their Mony at Intereſt, with the ſame hopes and like advantage, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times notwithſtanding fails them, as well as the Borrowers often labour for the Lender's Profit.</p>
                  <p>To the Ninth and Eighteenth. Here my Author hath ſome ſecret Meaning, or being conſcious of his own Errors, doth mark theſe two VVonders with a ☞ in the Margin. For why ſhould this great VVork of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching or Impoveriſhing of Kingdoms, be attributed to the Exchange, which is done only by thoſe means that do Over or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance our Forein Trade, as I have already ſo often ſhewed, and as the very words of <hi>Malines</hi> himſelf in theſe two Places, may intimate to a Judicious Reader?</p>
                  <p>To the Fifteenth and Sixteenth, I confeſs, that the Exchange may be uſed in turning Baſe Mony into Gold or Silver; as when a Stranger may coin and bring over a great Quantity of Farthings, which, in ſhort time, he may diſperſe or convert into good Mony, and then deliver the ſame here by Exchange, to receive the Value in his own Country; or he may do this Feat by carrying away the ſaid good Mony <hi>in Specie,</hi> without uſing the Exchange at all, if he dare venture the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law. The Spaniards know well who are the common Coiners of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, that dare venture to bring them ſtore of Copper-mony of the Spaniſh Stamp, and carry away the Value in good Ryals of Eight, wherein, notwithſtanding all their cunning devices, they are ſometimes taken tardy.</p>
                  <p>To the Seventeenth. The Bankers are always ready to receive ſuch Sums of Mony as are put into their hands by Men of all Degrees, who have no Skill or good Means themſelves to manage the ſame upon the Exchange to Profit. It is likewiſe true, that the Bankers do repay all Men with their own, and yet reſerve good Gain to themſelves; which they do as well deſerve for their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Proviſion or Allowance, as thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do which Buy or Sell for Merchants by Commiſſion: And is not this likewiſe both Juſt and very Common?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">

I muſt confeſs, that here is a VVonder indeed, that a poor Prince ſhould keep either his VVars or VVares (I take both together as the Author ſets them down both ways differing in his ſaid two Books) upon Intereſt-Mony, for what needs the Enemy of ſuch a poor Prince deal with the Bankers, to diſapoint him or defeat him of his Mony in time of want, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt itſelf will do this faſt enough; and ſo I leave this poor Stuff.</p>
                  <p>To the Nineteenth. I have lived long in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the greateſt Banks and Bankers of Chriſtedom do trade, yet could I never ſee nor hear, that they did, or were able, to rule the Price of Exchange by Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but ſtill the Plenty or Scarcity of Mony in the courſe of Trade, did always over-rule them, and made the Exchanges to run at high or low Rates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Exchange hinders not Princes of their Cuſtoms.</note>To the Twenty Second. The Exchange by Bills between Merchant and Merchant in the courſe of Trade, cannot hinder Princes of their Cuſtoms and Impoſts: For the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which one Man delivereth, becauſe he will not, or hath not occaſion to employ it in VVares another Man taketh, becauſe he either will, or hath already, laid it out in Merchandize. But it is true, that when the Wealth of a Kingdom conſiſteth much in ready Mony, and that there is alſo good Means and Conveniency in ſuch a Kingdom to Trade with the ſame into Forein Parts, either by Sea or Land, or by both theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98306:251"/>Ways; if then this Trade be neglected, the King ſhall be defeated of thoſe Profits; and if the Exchange be the Cauſe thereof, then muſt we learn in what manner this is done, for we may Exchange either amongſt our ſelves, or with Strangers; if amongſt our ſelves, the Common-wealth cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched thereby; for the Gain of one Subject is the Loſs of another. And if we Exchange with Strangers, then our Profit is the Gain of the Common wealth. Yet by none of theſe ways can the King receive any Benefit in his Cuſtoms. Let us therefore ſeek out the Places where ſuch Exchanging is uſed, and ſet down the Reaſons why this Practice is permitted; in ſearch whereof, we ſhall only find one Place of note in all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is <hi>Genoua,</hi> whereof I intend to ſay ſomething as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the Common-Wealth of
<hi>Genoua.</hi>
                     </note>The State of <hi>Genoua</hi> is ſmall, and not very Fertile, having little Natural Wealth or Materials to employ the People, nor yet Victuals ſufficient to feed them; but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, by their Induſtry in former times by Forein Trade into <hi>Aegypt, Soria, Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and all thoſe Levant Parts for Spices, Drugs, Raw Silks, and many other Rich Wares, with which they ſerved the moſt Places of
<hi>Europe,</hi> they grew to an incredible Wealth, which gave life unto the Strength of their Cities, the Pomp of their Buildings, and other ſingular Beauties. But after the Foundation and Increaſe of that Famous City of
<hi>Venice,</hi> the ſaid Trades turned that way. And ſince likewiſe the greateſt Part thereof doth come into <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> by Navigation, directly from the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which alterations in the Traffick, hath forced them of
<hi>Genoua</hi> to change their courſe of Trading with Wares, into Exchanging of their Mony: which, for Gain, they ſpread not only into divers Countries where the Trade is performed with Merchandize; but more eſpecially, they do therewith ſerve the want of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> and other Places, for their Wars, whereby the Private Merchants are much Enriched, but the Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by this Courſe is not increaſed, and the Reaſons why the Common-wealth of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> doth ſuffer this Inconvenience, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, and Privcipally, they are forced to leave thoſe Trades which they cannot keep from other Nations, who have better means by Situation, Wares, Shipping, Munition, and the like, to perform theſe Affairs with more advantage than they are able to do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They proceed like a wife State, who ſtill retain as much Trade as they can, although they are not able to procure the Twentieth Part of that which they had. For having few or no Materials of their own to employ their People, yet they ſupply this want by the Fleece-wools of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and Raw Silks of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> working them into Velvets, Damasks, Sattens, Wollen-drapery, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manufactures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas they find no means in their own Country to employ and Trade their great Wealth to <hi>Profit,</hi> they content themſelves to do it in <hi>Spain</hi> and other places, either in Merchandize, or by Exchanging their Monies for gain, to thoſe Merchants who trade therewith in Wares. And thus, whereſoever they live abroad for a Time, circulting the World for Gain; yet in the end, the Centre of this Profit is in their own Native Country.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Government of <hi>Genoua</hi> being
<hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> they are aſſured, that although the Publick get little, yet if their Private Merchants gain much from Strangers, they ſhall do well enough, becauſe the <hi>Richeſt</hi> and <hi>Secureſt Treaſure of a Free State, are the riches of the Nobility,</hi> (who in <hi>Genoua</hi> are Merchants) which falleth not out ſo in a Monarchy, where between the comings in of a Prince, and the means of Private Men, there is this Diſtinction of <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> but in the Occaſions and Dangers of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick or Common-wealth, where Liberty and Government might be changed into Servitude, there the <hi>Proper ſubſtance of private Men is the publick Treaſure,</hi> ready to be ſpent with their lives in defence of their own Sovereignty.</p>
                  <p>To the Twenty Fourth. If a Merchant ſhould buy VVares here, with intentions to ſend them for <hi>Venice,</hi> and then value them as the Exchange comes from thence to <hi>London,</hi> he may find himſelf far wide of his reckoning: For before his Goods arrive at <hi>Venice,</hi> both the Price of his VVares and the Rate of the Exchange, may alter very much. But if the meaning of the Author be, that this Valuation may be made after the Goods arrive, and are ſold at <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Mony remitted hither by Exchange; or elſe the Mony which bought the ſaid VVares here, may be valued as the Exchange paſſed at that time from hence to <hi>Venice;</hi> Is not all this very common and eaſie Buſineſs, unworthy to be put into the Number of <hi>Admirable Feats?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Tenth. Although a rich Prince hath great Power, yet is there not Power in every rich Prince to make the Staple of Mony run where he pleaſeth: For the Staple of any thing is not where it may be had, but where the thing doth moſt of all abound. VVhereupon we commonly ſay, that the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> in regard of his great Treaſure in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> hath the Fountain or Staple of Mony, which he moveth and cauſeth to run into <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> or other Places where his occaſions do <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98306:252"/>require it, either for Peace or War. Neither is this effected by any ſingular Power of the Exchange, but by divers Ways and Means; fitting thoſe Places where the Mony is to be employed. For if the Uſe thereof be upon the Confines of <hi>France</hi> to maintain a War there, then may it be ſafely ſent <hi>in Specie</hi> on Carriages by Land; if in <hi>Italy,</hi> on Gallies by Sea; if in the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by Sea alſo, but yet with more danger, in regard of his Potent Enemies in that Paſſage. Wherefore in this Occaſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Exchange is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet is it very uſeful. And becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> want of Gommodities from
<hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> is greater in value, than the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wares which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into thoſe Parts, therefore the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot be furniſhed there from his own Subjects with Mony by Exchange, but is and hath been a long time enforc'd to carry a great Part of his Treaſure in Gallies for <hi>Italy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the Italians are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to furniſh
<hi>Spain</hi> with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                     </note>where the
<hi>Italians,</hi> and amongſt them the Merchants of <hi>Genoua</hi> eſpecially, do take the ſame, and repay the Value thereof in
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whereunto they are enabled by their Trade with many rich Commodities, which they ſend continually out of <hi>Italy</hi> into thoſe Countries, and the Places thereabouts, from whence the <hi>Italians</hi> return no great value in Wares, but deliver their Mony for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and receive the Value by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in <hi>Italy</hi> out of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treaſure, which is brought thither in Gallies, as is afore-written.</p>
                  <p>So that by this we plainly ſee, that it is not the <hi>Power of Exchange</hi> that doth enforce Treaſure, where the rich Prince will have it, but it is the Mony proceeding of Wares in Forein Trade that doth enforce the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and rules the Price thereof high or low, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of the ſaid Mony; which in this Diſcourſe, upon all occaſions, I think I have repeated near as often as <hi>Malines</hi> in his Books, doth make the Exchange to be an eſſential Part of Trade, to be
<hi>Active, Predominant, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling the price of Wares and Monies, Life, Spirit, and the Worker of Admirable Feats.</hi> All which we have now briefly expounded; and let no Man admire why he himſelf did not take this Pains, for then he ſhould not only have taken away the great Opinion which he laboured to maintain of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but alſo by a true Diſcovery of the right Operation thereof, he ſhould utterly have overthrown his <hi>Par pro Pari;</hi> which Project (if it had prevailed) would have been a good Buſineſs for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to the great Hurt of this Common-wealth, as hath been ſufficiently proved in the 12th. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore let the learned Lawyer fall chearfully to his Books again, for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant cannot put him down, if he have no more skill than <hi>Admirable Feats,</hi> when they may be ſo eaſily known and done in the Courſe of Trade? Well then, if by this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery we have eaſed the Lawyer's Mind, and taken off the Edg of his admiration, let him now play his Part, and take out a <hi>Writ of Error,</hi> againſt the <hi>Par pro Pari;</hi> for this Project hath miſinformed many, and put us to trouble to expound theſe Riddles.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but ſtay a while, can all this paſs for currant, to ſlight a Buſineſs thus, which (the Author ſaith) hath been ſo ſeriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that Famous Council, and thoſe worthy Merchants of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Bleſſed Memory, and alſo condemned by thoſe French Kings, <hi>Lewis</hi> IX. <hi>Philip the Fair,</hi> and
<hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> with Confiſcation of the Banker's Goods? I muſt confeſs, that all this requires an Anſwer, which in part is already done by the Author himſelf. For he ſaith, that the Wiſdom of our State found out the Evil, but they miſſed of the remedy: and yet what Remedy this ſhould be, no Man can tell, for there was none applied; but all Practice and Uſe in Exchange ſtand ſtill to this Day, in ſuch Manner and Form as they did at the time when theſe Feats were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for the State knew well, that there needed no Remedy, where there was no Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Well then, how ſhall we be able to anſwer the Proceedings of the French Kings, who did abſolutely condemn the Bankers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated their Goods? Yes well enough, for the Bankers might perhaps be condemned for ſomething done in their Exchanges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law, and yet their profeſſion may ſtill be Lawful, as it is in <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this day. Nay, we will grant like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the Banks were baniſhed, when the Bankers were puniſhed; yet all this proves nothing againſt Exchangers, for Kings and States enact many Statutes, and ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal them, they do and undo; Princes may err, or elſe
<hi>Malines</hi> is groſly miſtaken,
<note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Free Trade <hi>p.</hi> 76, 77,
78, 79.</note>where he ſetteth down 35 ſeveral Statutes and other Ordinances, enacted by this State in 350 Years time, to remedy the decay of Trade, and yet all are found defective; only his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Exchange, or <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> is effectual, if we would believe him; but we know better, and ſo we leave him.</p>
                  <p>I might here take occaſion to ſay ſomething againſt another project of the ſame Brood, that lately attended upon the Succeſs of this <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> as I have been credibly informed, which is, the Changing and Rechanging here within the Realm, of all the Plate, Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Monies, Forein or Sterling, to paſs only by an Office, called, <hi>The King's Royal <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98306:252"/>Exchanger, or his Deputies,</hi> paying them a
<hi>Peny</hi> upon the Value of every <hi>Noble:</hi> which might raiſe much to their private Good, and deſtroy more to the publick Hurt. For it would decay the King's Coinage, deprive the Kingdom of much Treaſure, abridge the Subjects of their juſt Liberty, and utterly overthrow the Worthy Trade of
<hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> all which being Plain and Eaſie to the weakeſt Underſtandings, I will therefore omit to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſie upon theſe Particulars.</p>

                  <p>IT is not my Intent to Excuſe or Extenuate any the leaſt Exceſs or Evil in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but rather highly to Approve and Commend that which by others hath been Spoken and Written againſt ſuch Abuſes. Yet in this Diſcourſe of Treaſure, as I have already ſet down affirmatively, which are the true Cauſes that may either Augment or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the ſame: So is it not impertinent to continue my negative Declarations of thoſe Enormities and Actions which cannot work theſe Effects, as ſome Men have ſuppoſed: For in redreſs of this important Buſineſs, if we miſtake the Nature of the Malady, we ſhall ever apply ſuch Cures as will at leaſt delay, if not confound the Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Let us then begin with uſury, which if it might be turned into Charity, and that they who are Rich would lend to the Poor freely; it were a Work pleaſing to Almighty God, and profitable to the Common-wealth. But taking it in the Degree it now ſtands, how can we well ſay. That as
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury Increaſeth,</hi> ſo <hi>Trade Decreaſeth?</hi> For although it is true, that ſome Men give over Trading, and buy Lands, or put out their Mony to Uſe when they are grown Rich or Old, or for ſome other the like Occaſions; yet for all this it doth not follow, that the Quantity of the Trade muſt leſſen; for this Courſe in the Rich, giveth opportunity preſently to the Younger and Poorer Merchants to riſe in the World, and to enlarge their Dealings; to the Performance whereof, if they want means of their own, they may, and do, take it up at Intereſt: So that our Mony lies not dead, it is ſtill Traded. How many Merchants, and Shopkeepers have begun with little or nothing of their own, and yet are grown very Rich, by Trading with other Mens Mony? Do we not know, that when Trading is Quick and Good, many Men, by means of their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and having credit to take up Mony at Intereſt, do Trade for much more than they are worth of their own Stock; by which Diligence of the Induſtrious, the Affairs of the Common-wealth are Increaſed, the Monies of Widows, Orphans, Lawyers, Gentlemen, and others, are employed in the Courſe of Forein Trade, which themſelves have no skill to perform. We find at this preſent, that notwithſtanding the Poverty we are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Exceſſes and Loſſes of late times, yet that many Men have much Mony in their Cheſts, and know not how to diſpoſe thereof, becauſe the Merchant will not take the ſame at Intereſt, (although at low Rates) in regard there is a ſtop of Trade in <hi>Spain</hi> and in
<hi>France,</hi> whereby he cannot employ his own Means, much leſs other Mens Monies. So that for theſe, and ſome other Reaſons which might be alleged, we might conclude, contrary to thoſe who affirm, that Trade decreaſeth as Uſury increaſeth, for they <hi>riſe and fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next Place, We hear our Lawyers much condemned; the Vexation and Charges by multiplicity of Suits do exceed all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdoms of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> but whether this proceed from the Lawyer's Covetouſneſs, or the Peoples Perverſeneſs, is a great Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And let this be as it may, I will enquire not farther therein than our preſent Diſcourſe doth require, concerning the Decay of our Trade, and Impoveriſhing of the Kingdom. Sure I am, that Suits in Law make many a Man Poor and Penileſs, but how it ſhould make us Trade for leſs by one ſingle Peny, I cannot well conceive. For although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great number of them who are Vexed and Undone by Controverſies, there be ever ſome Merchants; yet we know, that one Man's Neceſſity becomes another Man's Opportunity. I never knew, as yet, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in our Trade and Treaſure for want of Merchants, or Means to employ us, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by exceſſive Conſumption of Forein Wares at home, or by a Declination in the Vent of our Commodities abroad, cauſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ruinous Effects of Wars, or ſome alterations in the times of Peace, whereof I have ſpoken more fully in the Third Chapter. But, to conclude with the Lawyers, I ſay, that their Noble Profeſſion is neceſſary to all, and their Caſes, Quillets, Delays and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are miſchievous to many; theſe things indeed are Cankers in the Eſtates of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, but not of the Common-wealth, as ſome ſuppoſe, for one Man's Loſs becomes another Man's Gain; it is ſtill in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I wiſh it might as ſurely remain in the right Places.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, All kind of Bounty and Pomp is not to be avoided; for if we ſhould become ſo Frugal, that we would uſe few or no Forein Wares, how ſhall we then vent our own Commodities? What will become of our Ships,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98306:253"/>Mariners, Munitions, our poor Artificers, and many others? Do we hope that other Countries will afford us Mony for All our Wares, without Buying or Battering for Some of theirs? This would prove a vain Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is more Safe and Sure to run a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Courſe, by ſpending moderately, which will purchaſe Treaſure plentifully. Again, the Pomp of Buildings, Apparel, and the like, in the Nobility, Gentry, and other able Perſons, cannot impoveriſh the Kingdom; if it be done with curious and coſtly Works upon our Materials, and by our own People, it will maintain the Poor with the Purſe of the Rich, which is the beſt Diſtribution of the Common-wealth. But if any Man ſay, that when the People want Work, the then Fiſhing Trade would be a better Employment, and far more Profitable; I ſubſcribe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For in that great buſineſs, there is means enough to employ both Rich and Poor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there hath been much ſaid and written; It reſteth only, that ſomething might be as well effected for the Honour and Wealth, both of the King and his Kingdoms.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. How the Revenues and Incoms of Princes may juſtly be raiſed.</head>
                  <p>NOw that we have ſet down the true Courſe by which a Kingdom may be enriched with Treaſure; In the next Place, we will endeavour to ſhew the Ways and Means by which a King may juſtly ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without the Hurt or Oppreſſion of his Subjects. The Revenues of Princes as they differ much in quantity, according to the Greatneſs, Riches and Trade of their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Dominons; ſo likewiſe is there great diverſity uſed in procuring the ſame, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſtitution of the Countries, the Government, Laws and Cuſtoms of the People, which no Prince can alter, but with much difficulty and Danger. Some Kings have their Crown-Lands, the firſt Fruits upon Eccleſiaſtical Livings, Cuſtoms, Tolls and Impoſts, upon all Trade to and from Forein Countries; Loans, Donations and Subſidies, upon all neceſſary occaſions. Other Princes and States leaving the three laſt, do add unto the reſt, a Cuſtom upon all new Wares tranſported from one City, to be uſed in any other City or Place of their own Dominions, Cuſtoms upon every alienation or ſale of live Cattel, Lands, Houſes, and the Portions or Marriage Mony of Women, Licence-mony upon all Victualing-Houſes and Innkeepers, Head-mony, Cuſtom upon all the Corn, Wine, Oyl, Salt, and the like, which Grown and are Conſumed in their own Dominions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which ſeem to be a Rabble of Oppreſſions, ſerving to enrich thoſe Princes which exact them, and to make the People Poor and Miſerable which endure them; eſpecially in thoſe Countries where theſe Burdens are laid at heavy rates, as 4, 5, 6, and 7, <hi>per Cent.</hi> But when all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Diſtinction of Places are duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they will be found not only neceſſary, and therefore lawful to be uſed in ſome States, but alſo in divers reſpects very profitable to the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt there are ſome States, as namely <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Florence, Genoua,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and others, which are ſingular for Beauty, and excellent both for Natural and Artificial Strength, having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rich Subjects: yet being of no very great Extent, nor enjoying ſuch Wealth by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revenues, as might ſupport them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſudden and powerful invaſions of thoſe mighty Princes which do inviron them; they are therefore enforced to ſtrengthen themſelves, not only with Confederates and Leagues, (which may often fail them in their greateſt need) but alſo by maſſing up ſtore of Treaſure and Munition by thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſes before-written, which cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, but will ever be ready to make a good Defence, and to offend or divert their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Neither are theſe heavy Contributions ſo hurtful to the Happineſs of the People, as they are commonly eſteemed: For as the Food and Rayment of the Poor is made dear by Exciſe, ſo doth the Price of their labour riſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; whereby the Burden (if any be) is ſtill upon the Rick, who are either idle, or at leaſt work not in this kind, yet have they the Uſe, and are the great Conſumers of the Poors Labour: Neither do the Rich neglect in their ſeveral Places and Callings to advance their Endeavours, according to thoſe times which do exhauſt their Means and Revenues; wherein, if they ſhould peradventure fail, and therefore be forced to abate their ſinful Exceſs and idle retainers; what is all this but happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a Common wealth, when Virtue, Plenty and Arts, ſhall thus be advanced all together? Nor can it be truly ſaid, that a Kingdom is impoveriſhed, where Loſs of the People is the Gain of the King, from whom alſo ſuch yearly Incoms have their annual iſſue to the Benefit of his Subjects; except only that part of the Treaſure which is laid up for the Publick Good; wherein likewiſe they who ſuffer have their ſafety, and therefore ſuch contributions are both Juſt and Profitable.</p>
                  <p>Yet here we muſt confeſs, that as the beſt things may be corrupted, ſo theſe taxes may be abuſed, and the Common wealth notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wronged when they are vainly Waſted and Conſumed by a Prince, either upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98306:253"/>worthy Perſons, ſuch as deſerve neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nor Countenance from the Majeſty of a Prince; but theſe dangerous Diſorders are ſeldom ſeen, eſpecially in ſuch States as are afore-named, becauſe the diſpoſing of the Publick Treaſure is in the Power, and under the Diſcretion of many; Neither is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all other Principalities and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the end of ſuch Exceſſes is ever ruinous, for they cauſe great Want and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, which often drives them from all order to exorbitance, and therefore it is common Policy amongſt Princes to prevent ſuch Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs with great Care and Providence, by doing nothing that may cauſe the Nobility to deſpair of their ſafety, nor leaving any thing undone which may gain the good Will of the Commonalty, to keep all in due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>But now before we end this Point in hand, we muſt remember likewiſe that all Bodies are not of one and the ſame Conſtitution; for that which is Phyſick to one Man, is little better than Poyſon to another:
<note place="margin">Some States can not ſubſiſt, but by the means of Heavy Taxes.</note>The States afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, and divers others like to them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt by the help of thoſe extraordinary Contributions, whereof we have ſpoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not able otherwiſe in ſhort time, to raiſe ſufficient Treaſure to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a Potent Enemy, who hath Power to invade them on the ſudden, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. But a Mighty Prince, whoſe Dominions are great and United, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects many and Loyal, his Countries rich both by Nature and Traffick, his Victuals and Warlike Proviſions plentiful and ready, his Situation eaſie to offend others, and difficult to be Invaded, his Harbors good, his Navy ſtrong, his Alliance powerful, and his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revenues ſufficient,
<note place="margin">Princes, who have no juſt cauſe to ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and heavy Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Subjects.</note>Royally to ſupport the <hi>Majeſty of his State;</hi> beſides a reaſonable Sum which may be advanc'd to lay up yearly in Treaſure for future Occaſions: ſhall not all theſe Bleſſings (being well ordered) enable a Prince againſt the ſudden Invaſion of any Mighty Enemy, without impoſing thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and Heavy Taxes? Shall not the Wealthy and Loyal Subjects of ſuch a Great and Juſt Prince, maintain his Honour and their own Liberties with Life and Goods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſupplying the Treaſure of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, until by a well-ordered War he may enforce a happy Peace? Yes verily, it cannot otherwiſe be expected. And thus ſhall a mighty Prince be more powerful in preſerving the Wealth and Love of his Subjects, than by Treaſuring up their Riches with unneceſſary Taxes, which cannot but alter and provoke them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but ſay ſome Men, we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict all this by Example taken from ſome of the greateſt Monarchs in
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who, beſides thoſe Incomes which here are termed ordinary, they add likewiſe all, or the moſt of the other heavy Contributions. All which we grant, and more; for they uſe alſo to ſell their Offices and Places of Juſtice, which is an act both baſe and wicked, becauſe it rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth worthy Men of their Merits, and betrayeth the Cauſe of the Innocent, whereby God is diſpleaſed, the People oppreſſed, and Virtue baniſhed from ſuch unhappy Kingdoms: Shall we then ſay, that theſe things are lawful and neceſſary becauſe they are uſed? God forbid, we know better, and we are well aſſured that theſe Exactions are not taken for a neceſſary Defence of their own Right, but through Pride and Covetouſneſs to add Kingdom to Kingdom, and ſo to uſurp the right of others:

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. Whether it be neceſſary for Great Princes to lay up Store of Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we ſet down the Quantity of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which Princes may conveniently lay up yearly, without hurting the Common-Wealth, it will be fit to examin whether the Act itſelf of Treaſuring be neceſſary: For in common conference we ever find ſome Men, who do ſo much dote or hope upon the Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Princes, that they term it Baſeneſs, and conceive it needleſs for them to lay up ſtore of Treaſure, accounting the Honour and Safety of great Princes to conſiſt more in their Bounty than in their Mony, which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to confirm by the Examples of <hi>Caeſar, Alexander,</hi> and others, who hating Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, atchieved many Acts and Victories by laviſh Gifts and liberal Expences. Unto which they add alſo the <hi>little Fruit,</hi> which came by that <hi>great Sum of Mony</hi> which King
<hi>David</hi> laid up and left to his Son <hi>Solomon;</hi> who, notwithſtanding this, and all his other rich Preſents, and wealthy Traffick in a quiet Reign, conſumed all with Pomp and vain Delights, excepting only that which was ſpent in Building of the Temple. Whereupon (ſay they,) if ſo much Treaſure, gathered by ſo juſt a King, effect ſo little, what ſhall we hope for by the Endeavours of this kind in other Princes?
<hi>Sardanapalus</hi> left Ten Millions of Pounds to them that flew him.
<hi>Darius</hi> left Twenty Millions of Pounds to <hi>Alexander</hi> that took him; <hi>Nero</hi> being left rich, and extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much from his beſt Subjects, gave away<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98306:254"/>above Twelve Millions of Pounds to his baſe Flatterers, and ſuch unworthy Perſons, which cauſed <hi>Galba</hi> after him to revoke thoſe Gifts. A Prince who hath ſtore of Mony, hates Peace, deſpiſeth the Friendſhip of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Allies, enters not only into unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but alſo into dangerous Wars, to ruin and overthrow (ſometimes) of his own Eſtate: All which, with divers other weak Arguments of this kind, (which for brevity I omit) make nothing againſt the Lawful Gathering and Maſſing up of Treaſure by wiſe and provident Princes, if they be rightly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, concerning thoſe worthies who have obtained to the higheſt top of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> by their great Gifts and Expences, who knows not that this hath been done rather upon the Spoils of their Enemies than out of their own Coffers, which is indeed a Bounty that cauſeth neither Loſs nor Peril? Whereas on the contrary, thoſe Princes which do not providently lay up Treaſure, or do immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely conſume the ſame when they have it, will ſuddenly come to Want and Miſery;
<note place="margin">Exceſs and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brings Beggary, which makes moſt Men deviſe in their heads how to extort and get Mony into their hands.</note>for there is nothing doth ſo ſoon decayas Exceſſive Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in uſing whereof they want the means to uſe it. And this was King
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Caſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his infinite Treaſure, which made him over-burthen his Subjects in ſuch a manner, that (for this Cauſe) many of them rebelled againſt his Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by loſt a great Part of his Dominions, being ſo groſly miſled by his young Counſellors. Therefore a Prince that will not oppreſs his People, and yet be able to maintain his Eſtate, and defend his Right, that will not run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Poverty, Contempt, Hate, and Danger, muſt lay up Treaſure, and be thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for further proof whereof I might yet produce ſome other Examples, which here I do omit as needleſs.</p>
                  <p>Only I will add this as a neceſſary Rule to be obſerved, that when more Treaſure muſt be raiſed than can be received by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Taxes, it ought ever to be done with equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to avoid the Hate of the People, who are never pleaſed except their Contributions be granted by general conſent: For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the Inventions of Parliaments is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Policy of Government, to keep a ſweet Concord between a King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by reſtraining the Inſolency of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and redreſſing the Injuries of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, without engaging a Prince to adhere to either Party, but indifferently to favour both. There could nothing be deviſed with more judgment for the common Quiet of a Kingdom, or with greater care for the Safety of a King, who hereby hath alſo good means to diſpatch thoſe things by others, which will move Envy, and to execute that himſelf which will merit Thanks.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. How much Treaſure a Prince may conveniently lay up Yearly.</head>
                  <p>THus far we have ſhewed the Ordinary and Extraordinary incomes of Princes, the Conveniency thereof, and to whom only it doth neceſſarily and juſtly belong, to take the Extraordinary Contributions of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. It reſteth now to examin what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treaſure each particular Prince may conveniently lay up yearly. This buſineſs doth ſeem at the firſt to be very Plain and Eaſie; for if a Prince have Two Millions yearly Revenue, and ſpend but one; why ſhould he not lay up the other? Indeed I muſt confeſs, that this Courſe is ordinary in the Means and Gettings of Private Men, but in the Affairs of Princes it is far different; there are other circumſtances to be conſidered, for although the Revenue of a King ſhould be very great,
<note place="margin">Forein Trade muſt give proportion to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which is laid up yearly.</note>yet if the Gain of the Kingdom be but ſmall, this Latter muſt ever give Rule and Proportion to that Treaſure, which may conveniently be laid up yearly; for if he ſhould maſs up more Mony than is gained by the Over-ballance of his Forein Trade, he ſhall not <hi>Fleece</hi> but <hi>Flea</hi> his Subjects, and ſo with their ruin overthrow himſelf for want of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Sheerings. To make this Plain, Suppoſe a Kingdom to be rich by Nature and Art, that it may ſupply itſelf of Forein Wares by Trade, and yet advance yearly 200000 <hi>l.</hi> in ready Mony: Next, Suppoſe all the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to be 900000 <hi>l.</hi> and his Expences but 400000 <hi>l.</hi> whereby he may lay up 300000 <hi>l.</hi> more in his Coffers yearly, than the whole Kingdom gains from Strangers by Forein Trade; who ſees not then at all the Mony in ſuch a State, would ſuddenly be drawn into the Prince's Treaſure, whereby the Life of Lands and Arts muſt Fail and Fall to the ruin both of the Publick and Private Wealth?
<note place="margin">A Prince whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have but little Forein Trade cannot lay up much Mony.</note>So that a King who deſires to lay up much Mony, muſt endeavour by all good means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and increaſe his Forein Trade, becauſe it is the ſole way, not only to lead him to his own ends, but alſo to enrich his Subjects to his farther Benefit: For a Prince is eſteemed no leſs powerful, by having many rich well affected Subjects, than by poſſeſſing much Treaſure in his Coffers.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt meet with an Objection, which peradventure may be made concerning ſuch States (whereof I have formerly ſpoken) which are of no great Extent, and yet bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon mighty Princes, are therefore conſtrained to lay extraordinary Taxes upon their Subjects, whereby they procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very great incomes yearly, and are rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided againſt any Forein Invaſions; yet<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98306:254"/>have they no ſuch great Trade with Strangers, as that the Over ballance or Gain of the ſame, may ſuffice to lay up the one half of that which they advance yearly, beſides their own Expences.</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is, that ſtill the Gain of their Forein Trade muſt be the Rule of laying up their Treaſure, the which although it ſhould not be much yearly; yet in the time of a long continued Peace, and being well managed to advantage, it will become a great Sum of Mony, able to make a long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which may End or Divert the War. Neither are all the Advances of Princes ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tied to be maſſed up in Treaſure, for they have other no leſs neceſſary and profitable Ways to make them Rich and Powerful, by iſſuing out continually a great Part of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their yearly Incomes to their Subjects from whom it was firſt taken; as namely, by employing them to make Ships of War, with all the Proviſions thereunto belonging, to build and repair Forts, to buy and ſtore up Corn in the Granaries of each Province for a Years uſe (at leaſt) aforehand, to ſerve in occaſion of Dearth, which cannot be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by a State but with great Danger, to erect Banks with their Mony, for the Increaſe of their Subjects Trade, to maintain in their Pay, Colonels, Captains, Soldiers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Mariners, and others, both by Sea and Land, with good Diſcipline, to fill their Storehouſes, (in ſundry ſtrong Places)
<note place="margin">Munition for War ought to be kept in divers Places of the State to prevent the Loſs of all by Treachery in one Place.</note>and to abound in Gun-powder, Brimſtone, Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre, Shot, Ordnance, Muſquets, Swords, Pikes, Armours, Horſes, and in many other ſuch like Proviſions fitting for War; all which will make them to be feared abroad and loved at home, eſpecially if care be taken that all (as near as poſſible) be made out of the Matter and Manufacture of their own Subject, which bear the Burden of the yearly Contributions; for a Prince (in this Caſe) is like the Stomach in the Body, which if it ceaſe to digeſt and diſtribute to the other Members, it doth no ſooner corrupt them, but it deſtroys itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen, that a ſmall State may lay up a great Wealth in Neceſſary Proviſions, which are Princes Jewels, no leſs precious than their Treaſure; for in time of need they are ready, and cannot otherwiſe be had (in ſome places) on the ſudden, whereby a State may be loſt, whilſt Munition is in Providing: So that we may account that Prince as poor who can have no Wares to buy at his need, as he that hath no Mony to buy Wares for although <hi>Treaſure is ſaid to be the Sinews of the War,</hi> yet this is ſo becauſe it doth provide, Unite and Move the Power of Men, Victuals, and Munition, where and when the Cauſe doth require; but if theſe things be wanting in due time, what ſhall we then do with our Mony? The Conſideration of this, doth cauſe divers well-governed States to be exceeding provident, and well furniſhed of ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, eſpecially thoſe Granaries and Store-Houſes with that famous <hi>Arſenal</hi> of the
<hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> are to be admired for the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Buildings, the Quantity of the Munitions and Stores both for Lea and Land, the Multitude of the Workmen, the Divern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Excellency of the Arts, with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Government. They are rare and worthy Things for Princes to behold and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; for Majeſty, without providence of competent Force, and Ability of neceſſary Proviſions is un-aſſured.</p>

For what greater Glory and Advantage can any powerful Nation have, than to be thus Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Naturally poſſeſſed of all things needful for Food, Rayment, War, and Peace, not only for its own plentiful uſe, but alſo to ſupply the Wants of other Nations, in ſuch a meaſure, that much Mony may be thereby gotten yearly, to make the happineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. For Experience telleth us, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that exceſſive Conſumption of<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98306:255"/>this Kingdom alone, to ſay nothing of
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is exported <hi>Communibus annis</hi> of of our own Native Commodities for the Value of Twenty two hundred thouſand Pounds
<hi>Sterling,</hi> or ſomewhat more; ſo that if we were not too much affected to Pride, monſtrous faſhions, and Riot, above all other Nations, one Million and an half of Pounds might plentifully ſupply our unneceſſary wants (as I may term them) of Silks, Sugars, Spices, Fruits, and all others; ſo that Seven hundred Pounds might be yearly treaſur'd up in Mony to make the Kingdom exceeding Rich and Powerful in ſhort time. But this great Plenty which we enjoy, makes us a People not only <hi>Vicious</hi> and <hi>Exceſſive,</hi> waſtful of the Means we have, but alſo improvident and Careleſs of much other Wealth that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully we loſe, which is, the Fiſhing in his Majeſty's Seas of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being of no leſs conſequence than all our other Riches which we Export and Vent to Strangers,
<note place="margin">The fruits of Idleneſs which are
<hi>Englands</hi> common reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es among Strangers.</note>whilſt in the mean time (through lewd Idleneſs) great multitudes of our People Cheat, Roar, Rob, Hang, Beg, Cant, Pine, and Periſh, which by this Means and Maintenance might be much increaſed, to the further VVealth and Srength of theſe Kingdoms, eſpecially by Sea, for our own Safety, and Terror of our enemies. The Endeavours of the Induſtrious Dutch, do give ſufficient teſtimony of this Truth, to <hi>our great ſhame, and no leſs peril,</hi> if it have not a timely Prevention: For, whilſt we leave our wonted honourable Exerciſes and Studies, following our Pleaſures, and of late years beſotting our ſelves with Pipe and Pot, in a Beaſtly manner, ſucking Smoak, and drinking Healths, until Death ſtares many in the Face; the ſaid Dutch have well-near left this Swiniſh Vice, and taken up our wonted Valour, which we have often ſo well performed both by Sea and Land, and particularly in their Defence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo thankful as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the ſame.
<note place="margin">The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note>The ſum of all is this, that the general Leproſie of our Piping, Potting, Feaſting, Faſhions, and Mis-ſpending our time in Idleneſs and Pleaſure (contrary to the Law of God, and the Uſe of other Nations) hath made us effeminate in our Bodies, weak in our Knowledg, poor in our Treaſure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in our Valour, unfortunate in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and contemned by our Enemies. I write the more of theſe Exceſſes, becauſe they do ſo greatly waſte our Wealth, which is the main Subject of this whole Book's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to admire and fear, if we would but add <hi>Art</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> to our
<hi>Natural Means;</hi> the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath given a notable Advantage to other <hi>Nations,</hi> and eſpecially to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whereof I will briefly ſay ſomething in the next-Place.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, I will deliver my Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our
<hi>Cloathing,</hi> which although it is the greateſt Wealth and beſt Employment of the Poor of this Kingdom; yet nevertheleſs we may peradventure employ our ſelves with better Safety, Plenty, and Profit, in uſing more Tillage and Fiſhing, than to truſt ſo wholly to the making of Cloth? for in times of War, or by other occaſions, if ſome Forein Princes ſhould prohibit the Uſe thereof in their Dominions, it might ſuddenly cauſe much Poverty and dangerous Uproars; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by our Poor People, when they ſhould be deprived of their ordinary Maintenance, which cannot ſo eaſily fail them, when their Labours ſhould be divided into the ſaid diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Employments, whereby alſo many thouſands would be the better enabled to do the Kingdom good Service in occaſion of War, eſpecially by Sea: And ſo leaving <hi>England,</hi> we will paſs over into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Plenty and Power do make a Nation Vicious and Improvident, ſo Penury and Want do make a People Wiſe and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Concerning the laſt of theſe, I might inſtance divers Common-wealths of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who having little or nothing in their own Territories,
<note place="margin">The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Induſtry.</note>do notwithſtanding pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe great Wealth and Strength, by their induſtrious Commerce with Strangers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the United Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are now of greateſt Note and Fame: For ſince they have caſt off the Yoke of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſlavery, how wonderfully are they improved in all human Policy? What great means have they obtained in defending their Liberty againſt the Power of ſo great an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? And is not all this performed by their continual Induſtry in the Trade of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize? Are not their Provinces the <hi>Magizines</hi> and
<hi>Store houſes of Wares</hi> for moſt places of Chriſtendom, whereby their Wealth, Shipping, Mariners, Arts, People, and thereby the Publick Revenues and Exciſe are grown to a wonderful Height? If we compare the Times of their Subjection, to their preſent Eſtate, they ſeem not the ſame People;
<note place="margin">Thoſe Princes which willingly ſupport the
<hi>Dutch</hi> would as reſolutely reſiſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
                     </note>for who knows not that the Condition of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces was mean and Turbulent under the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Government, which brought rather a greater Charge then a further Strength to to their Ambition; neither would it prove over difficult for the Neighbour Princes in ſhort time, to reduce thoſe Countries to their former Eſtate again, if their own ſafety did require the ſame, as certainly it would if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were ſole Lord of thoſe <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> but our Diſcourſe tends not to ſhew the Means of thoſe Mutations, otherwiſe than to find out the chief Foundation of the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s Wealth and Greatneſs: For it ſeems a wonder to the World, that ſuch a <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98306:255"/>ſmall Country, not fully ſo big as two of our biggeſt Shires, having little natural Wealth, Victuals, Timber, or other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Ammunitions, either for War or Peace, ſhould notwithſtanding poſſeſs them all in ſuch extraordinary Plenty, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their own wants, (which are very great) they can and do likewiſe ſerve and ſell to other Princes, Ships, Ordnance, Cordage, Corn, Powder, Shot, and what not, which by their induſtrious Trading they gather from all the Quarters of the World:
<note place="margin">Much Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, but little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</note>In which courſes they are not leſs injurious to ſupplant others, (eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) than they are careful to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves And to effect this, and more than hath been ſaid, (which is their War with <hi>Spain</hi>) they have little Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the Fiſhing, <hi>which is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in His Majeſty's Seas,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Means of an incredible Wealth and Strength both by Sea and Land, as
<hi>Robert Hichcock, Tobias Gentleman,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have publiſhed at large in print, to them that liſt to read. And the <hi>States-General</hi> themſelves in their Proclamation, have ingeniouſly ſet out the Worth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in theſe words following,
<note place="margin">Part of the States Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dated in the
<hi>Hague,</hi> 19. <hi>July,</hi> 1624.</note>
                     <hi>The great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, and catching of Herrings, is the chiefeſt Trade and principal Gold Mine of the United Provinces, whereby many Thouſands of Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, Families, Handicrafts, Trades and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, are ſet on work, well maintained and proſper, eſpecially the Sailing and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as well within as without theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is kept in great eſtimation; Moreover many returns of Money, with the Increaſe of the Means, Convoys, Cuſtoms, and Revenues of theſe Countries, are augmented thereby and proſper,</hi> with other words following, as is at large expreſſed in the ſaid Proclamation, ſet forth by the <hi>States-General</hi> for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſaid Trade of Fiſhing; without which it is apparent that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long ſubſiſt in Sovereignty; for if this Foundation periſh, the whole Building of their Wealth and Strength both by Sea and Land muſt fall; for the multitude of their Shipping would ſuddenly decay, their Revenues and Cuſtoms would become ſmall, their Countries would be Depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for want of Maintenance, whereby the Exciſe muſt fail, and all their other Trades to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> or elſewhere muſt faint. So that the Glory and Power of theſe <hi>Netherlands,</hi> conſiſteth in this, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Herrings, Ling, and Cod, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Seas.</hi> It reſteth therefore to know, what Right or Title they have thereunto, and how they are able to Poſſeſs and Keep the ſame, againſt all other Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer to theſe two Queſtions is not difficult: For firſt, It is not the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlandiſh</hi> Author of <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi> that can intitle them to Fiſh in His Majeſty's Seas. For beſides the Juſtice of the Cauſe, and Examples of other Countries, which might be alledged, I will only ſay, that ſuch Titles would be ſooner decided by Swords, than with Words; I do believe indeed, that it is free for the Fiſh to come thither at their Pleaſure, but for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to carry and carry them away from thence without His Majeſty's Licence, I harbour no ſuch Thought. <hi>There may be good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to connive ſtill, and ſo long to permit them this Fiſhing as they are in perfect league with</hi> England, <hi>and in War with</hi> Spain. But if the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were Maſters of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> as heretofore, it would nearly concern theſe Kingdoms to claim their own Right, and carefully to make as good uſe thereof, for Increaſe of their Wealth and Strength, to oppoſe that Potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as now the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> do, and are well enabled for the ſame Purpoſe: By which particular alone they are ever bound to acknowledge their ſtrong Alliance with <hi>England,</hi> above all other Nations; for there is none that hath the like good Means to lend them ſuch a Powerful maintenance.
<note place="margin">Fiſhing and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note>Nor were it poſſible for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (if he had thoſe Countries again) to make a new Foundation with the Power of his Money, to increaſe his Strength, either by Sea or Land, to offend theſe Kingdoms, more than he is now able to perform, with the Conveniency of thoſe Provinces which he hath already in his Poſſeſſion; for it is not the Place, but the Employment; not the Barren <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but the Rich Fiſhing, which gives Foundation, Trade, and Subſiſtence to thoſe multitudes of Ships, Arts, and People, whereby alſo the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and other publick Revenues are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and without which Employment all the ſaid great Dependences muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily disbandon and fail in very ſhort time. For although, I confeſs, that ſtore of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may bring them Materials (which they altogether want) and Arts-men to build them Shipping, yet where are the Wares, to Freight and Maintain them? If Mony then ſhall be the only means to ſend them out in Trade, what a poor number of Ships will this employ? Or if the uncertain Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of War muſt ſupport them, will not this require another <hi>Indies,</hi> and all too little to maintain the Tenth Part of ſo many Ships and Men as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do now ſet on work by the Fiſhing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trades thereon depending? But if it be yet ſaid, that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being Lord of all thoſe <hi>Netherlands,</hi> his Expence of the preſent War there will ceaſe, and ſo this Power may be turned upon us. The<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98306:256"/>Anſwer is, that when Princes ſend great Forces abroad to invade others, they muſt likewiſe increaſe their Charge and Strength at Home, to defend themſelves; and alſo we muſt conſider, that if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will attempt any thing upon theſe
<hi>Kingdoms,</hi> he muſt conſume a great Part of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Shipping, whereby the Means of his invading Power of Money and Men to land, will be much leſs than now it is in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> Nor ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, but be ever ready to beard them, when our Wealth and Strength by Sea and Land, might be ſo much increaſed by the Poſſeſſion and Practice of our Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, of which particular I will yet ſay ſomething more where occaſion ſhall be offered, in that which followeth. And here in this Place I will only add, that if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were ſole Lord of all the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> he muſt then neceſſarily drive a great Trade by Sea, to ſupply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wants of thoſe Countries, whereby in occaſion of War, we ſhould have means daily to take much Wealth from him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the <hi>Spaniard</hi> uſing little or no Trade in theſe Seas, but employing his Ships of War to the uttermoſt of his power, he only takes, and we loſe great matters continually.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the ſecond Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Hollanders be able to Poſſeſs and Keep this Fiſhing againſt all other Nations.</hi> It is very probable, that although they claim now no other right than their own freedom in this Fiſhing, ſeeming to leave the like to all others; yet if the Practice of any Nation ſhould ſeek either to Fiſh with them, or to ſupplant them, they would be both ready and able to maintain this
<hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mine,</hi> againſt the ſtrongeſt Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except
<hi>England,</hi> whoſe Harbours and In-lands, with other daily reliefs, are very needful, if not abſolutely neceſſary for this Employment, and whoſe Power alſo by Sea, is able (in ſhort time) to give this Buſineſs diſturbance, and utter Ruin, if the Occaſion ſhould be ſo urgent as afore ſuppoſed; Neither is it enough for any Man to contradict all this by ſaying, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are very ſtrong by Sea, when both Sea and Land encounter them with a greater Power: We muſt obſerve from whence their ſtrength grows, and if the Root be once ſpoiled, the Branches ſoon will wither; and therefore it were an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to eſteem, or value them according to the preſent Power and Wealth, which they have obtained by Trade or Purchaſe; for although this were far greater than indeed it is, yet would it ſoon be conſumed in a chargeable War againſt a Potent Enemy, when the Current of thoſe Accidents may be ſtop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and turned by preventing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance itſelf (which is the Fiſhing in His Majeſty's Seas) that gives foundation, and is the very Fountain of their ſtrength and happineſs: The <hi>United Provinces</hi> (we know) are like a fair Bird ſuited with goodly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed plumes; but if every Fowl ſhould take his Feather, this Bird would reſt near naked: Nor have we ever ſeen theſe <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> as yet, in their greateſt Occaſions, to ſet forth near ſo many Ships of War at once as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have often done, without any hindrance of their ordinary Traffick. It is true indeed, they have an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of weak Ships to fiſh with, and fetch Corn, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their own Victualling and Trading, the like to ſetch Timber, Plank, Boards, Pitch, Hemp, Tar, Flax, Maſts, Cordage, and other Ammunitions, to make thoſe multitudes of Ships,
<note place="margin">The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands Ploughs.</note>which unto them are as our Ploughs to us, the which except they ſtir, the People ſtarve; their Shipping therefore cannot be ſpared from their Traffick (as ours may if occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on require) no not for a very ſhort time, without utter ruin, becauſe it is the daily maintenance of their great multitudes which gain their living but from hand to Mouth, upon which alſo depends the great Exciſes, and other publick Revenues, which ſupport the State itſelf: Neither indeed are thoſe Veſſels ſtrong or fit for War; and in their proper uſe of Fiſhing and Trade, they would become the Riches, or the Purchaſe of a Potent Enemy by Sea, as they partly find by one poor Town of
<hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> notwithſtanding their great charge of Men of War, ſtrong Convoys, and other commendable diligence, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually they uſe to prevent this Miſchief: But if the Occaſion of a more powerful Enemy by Sea, ſhould force them to double or treble thoſe Charges, we may well doubt the Means of their continuance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when (by us) their Fiſhing might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs be prevented, which ſhould procure the Maintenance.

<hi>Netherlanders</hi> themſelves to ſeek their living here with us for want of better maintenance: Whereby our many decayed Sea-Towns and Caſtles would ſoon be re-edified, and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in more ample manner than formerly they were in their beſt Eſtate. And thus theſe forces being united, would be ever more ready, ſure and Vigorous, than a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Strength that lies divided, which is always ſubject to Delays, Diverſion, and other Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, of all which we ought not to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but perfectly to know, and uſe our own ſtrength when we have occaſion, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we muſt ever be watchful to preſerve this Strength, leſt the Subtilty of the <hi>Dutch</hi> (under ſome fair ſhews, and with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) prevail, as peradventure they lately practiſed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have had a Patent for the Poſſeſſing, Inhabiting, and Fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that excellent Iſland of <hi>Lewis</hi> in the <hi>Orcades;</hi> whoſe Situation, Harbours, Fiſhing, Fertility, Largeneſs, and other advantages, would have made them able (in ſhort time) to offend theſe Kingdoms by ſudden Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to have defended the aforeſaid Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt His Majeſty's greateſt Power, add alſo to ſend out and return home their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping proſperouſly that way, to and from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Streights,</hi> and other Places, without paſſing through His Majeſty's narrow Seas, where in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, this Kingdom now hath ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to take their Ships, and prevent their beſt Trades, which would ſoon bring them to ruin, whereby (as they well know) we have a greater Tie and Power over them than any other Nation. And howſoever the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Lewis</hi> might have been obtained in the Name of Private Men, and under the fair pretence of bringing Commerce into thoſe remote Parts of <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet in the end, when the Work had been brought to any goad Perfection, the Poſſeſſion and Power would no doubt have come to the Lords, the States-General, even as we know they have lately gotten divers places of great Strength and Wealth in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> in the Names and with the Purſe of their Merchants, whereby alſo their actions herein have been obſcur'd, and made <hi>leſs notorious</hi> unto the World, until they had obtained their <hi>Ends,</hi> which are of ſuch conſequence, that it doth much concern this Nation in particular, carefully to obſerve their proceedings, for they notoriouſly follow the Steps of that Valiant and Politick Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Macedon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Where Force fails yet Mony prevails; thus hopes the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</note>whoſe Maxim was, <hi>That where Force could not prevail, he always uſed Bribes and Mony, to corrupt thoſe who might advance his Fortune;</hi> by which Policy he gave Foundation to a Monarchy; and what know we but that the <hi>Putch</hi> may aim at ſome ſuch Sovereignty, when they ſhall find their <hi>Indian</hi> attempts and other ſubtil Plots, ſucceed ſo proſperouſly? Do we not ſee their Lands are now become too little to contain this ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People, whereby their Ships and Seas are made the Habitations of great multitudes? And yet, to give them further breed, are they not ſpared from their own Wars, to enrich the State and themſelves by Trade and Arts? Whilſt by this Policy many thouſands of Strangers are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drawn thither for performance of their Martial Employments, whereby the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of their Exciſes is ſo much the more increaſed, and all things ſo ſubtilly contrived, that although the <hi>Forein Soldier</hi> be well paid, yet all muſt be there again expended; and thus the Wealth remains ſtill in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; nor are the Strangers enriched which do them this great Service.</p>
                  <p>I have heard ſome <hi>Italians</hi> Wiſely and Worthily Diſcourſe of the Natural Strength and Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> which they make to be matchleſs, if we ſhould (but in part) apply our ſelves to ſuch Policies and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as are very commonly uſed in ſome other Countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> and much they have admired, that our Thoughts and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies attend only upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> greatneſs, never once ſuſpecting, but conſtantly embracing the
<hi>Netherlands</hi> as our beſt Friends and Allies; when in truth, (as they well obſerve) there are no People in Chriſtendom who do Undermine, Hurt, and Eclipſe us daily in our Navigation and Trades, both abroad and at home; and this not only in the rich Fiſhing in His Majeſty's Seas (whereof we have already written) but alſo in our In-Land Trades between City and City, in the Manufactures of Silks, Wools, and the like, made here in this Kingdom, wherein they never give Employment or Education in their Arts to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> but ever (according to the Cuſtom of the Jews, where they abide in <hi>Turky,</hi> and divers places of Chriſtendom) they live wholly to themſelves in their own Tribes. So that we may truly ſay of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> that although they are amongſt us, yet certainly they are not of us, no not they who are Born and Bred here in our own Country, for ſtill they will be <hi>Dutch,</hi> not having ſo much as one Drop of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood in their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>More might be written of theſe <hi>Netherland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Pride and Ambitious Endeavours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they hope in time to grow Mighty, if they be not prevented; and much more may be ſaid of their cruel and unjuſt Violence uſed (eſpecially to their beſt Friends, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) in matters of Blood, Trade, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, where they have had Advantage and Power to perform it; but theſe things are already publiſhed in Print, to the View and Admiration of the World, wherefore I will conclude, and the Sum of all is this, That<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98306:257"/>the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> which now are ſo great a Trouble, if not a Terror to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> were heretofore little better than a Charge to them in their Poſſeſſion, and would be ſo again in the like Occaſion, the Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I might yet further enlarge; but they are not pertinent to this Diſcourſe, more than is already declared, to ſhew the different Effects between <hi>Natural</hi> and
<hi>Artificial Wealth:</hi> The firſt of which, as is moſt Noble and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, being always ready and certain, ſo doth it make the People Careleſs, Proud, and given to all exceſſes; whereas the Second enforceth Vigilancy, Literature, Arts and Policy. My wiſhes therefore are, that as
<hi>England</hi> doth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully enjoy the one, and is fully capable of the other, that our Endeavours might as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily conjoyn them both together, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our vicious Idleneſs, and greater Glory of theſe Famous Kingdoms.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XX. The Order and Means whereby we may draw up the Ballance of our Forein Trade.</head>
                  <p>NOw, that we have ſufficiently proved the Ballance of our Forein Trade, to be the true Rule of our Treaſure; It reſteth that we ſhew by whom, and in what manner the ſaid Ballance may be drawn up at all times, when it ſhall pleaſe the State to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how we proſper or decline in this Great and Weighty Buſineſs, wherein the Officers of his Majeſty's Cuſtoms, are the only Agents to be employed, becauſe they have the Accounts of all the Wares which are iſſued out or brought into the Kingdom; and although (it is true) they cannot exactly ſet down the Coſt and Charges of other Mens Goods bought here or beyond the Seas; yet nevertheleſs, if they ground themſelves upon the Book of Rates, they ſhall be able to make ſuch an eſtimate as may well ſatisfie this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: For it is not expected, that ſuch an account can poſſibly be drawn up to a juſt Ballance, it will ſuffice only, that the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be not over great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How we muſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue our Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, concerning our Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we have valued their firſt coſt, we muſt add Twenty five <hi>per Cent.</hi> thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for the Charges here, for Freight of Ships, Inſurance of the <hi>Adventure,</hi> and the <hi>Merchant</hi>'s gains; and for our Fiſhing Trades, which pay no Cuſtom to His Majeſty, the Value of ſuch Exportations may be eaſily eſteem'd by good Obſervations which have been made, and may continually be made, according to the Increaſe or Decreaſe of thoſe Affairs, the preſent Eſtate of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity being valued at One Hundred and Forty Thouſand Pounds iſſued yearly. Alſo we muſt add to our Exportations, all the Monies which are carried out in Trade by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> For our Importations of Forein Wares, the Cuſtom-Books ſerve only to direct us concerning the Quantity, for we muſt not value them as they are rated here, but as they coſt us with all Charges laden into our Ships beyond the Seas, in the reſpective Places where they are bought: For the Merchan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s Gain, the Charges of Inſurance, Freight of Ships, Cuſtoms, Impoſts, and other Duties here, which do greatly indear them unto our Uſe and Conſumption, are, notwithſtanding, but Commutations amongſt our ſelves; for the Stranger hath no part thereof: Wherefore our ſaid Importations ought to be valued at Twenty Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> leſs than they are rated to be worth here. And although this may ſeem to be too great allowance upon many rich Commodities, which come but from the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and other Places near hand, yet will it be found reaſonable, when we conſider it in groſs Commodities, and upon Wares laden in remote Countries, as our Pepper, which coſt us, with charges, but Four pence the Pound: So that when all is brought into a <hi>Medium,</hi> the Valuation ought to be made as afore-written. And therefore, the Order which hath been uſed to multiply the full Rates upon Wares, inwards by Twenty, would produce a very great Error in the Ballance;
<note place="margin">The Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> is not only great in it ſelf, but it doth alſo make our other Trades much greater than they were.</note>for in this manner the Ten Thouſand Bags of Pepper, which this Year we have brought hither from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſhould be valued at very near Two Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds, whereas all this Pepper in the Kindom's Accompt, coſt not above Fifty Thouſand Pounds, becauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> have had no more of us, although we paid them extraordinary dear prices for the ſame. All the other Charges (as I have ſaid before) is but a Change of effects amongſt our ſelves, and from the Subject to the King, which cannot impoveriſh the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But it is true, That whereas Nine Thouſand Bags of the ſaid Pepper are already Shipp'd out for divers Forein Parts, Theſe and all other Wares, Forein or Domeſtick, which are thus tranſported Outwards, ought to be caſt up by the Rates of His Majeſty's Cuſtom-mony, Multiplyed by Twenty, or rather by Twenty Five, (as I conceive) which will come nearer the Reckoning, when we conſider all our Trades, to bring them into a
<hi>Medium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> We muſt remember, that all Wares Exported or Imported by Strangers, (in their Shipping) be eſteem'd by themſelves; for what they carry out, the Kingdom hath only the firſt Coſt and Cuſtom: And what they bring in, we muſt rate it as it is worth here, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Impoſt, and petty Charges only deducted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There muſt be good notice taken of all the great Loſſes which we receive at<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98306:257"/>Sea in our Shipping, either Outward or Homeward bound: For the Value of the one, is to be deducted from our Exportations, and the Value of the other is to be added to our Importations; for to Loſe and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume doth produce one and the ſame Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Likewiſe, If it happen that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty doth make over any great Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by Exchange, to maintain a Forein War, where we do not Feed and Cloath the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and provide the Armies, we muſt deduct all this Charge out of our Exportations, or add it to our Importations; for this Expence doth either carry out, or hinder the coming in of ſo much Treaſure. And here we muſt remember the great Collections of Mony, which are ſuppoſed to be made throughout the Realm yearly, from our Recuſants by Prieſts and Jeſuits, who ſecretly convey the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries which are both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</note>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this Miſchief cannot be prevented, yet it muſt be eſteem'd and ſet down as a clear Loſs to the Kingdom, except (to Ballance this) we will imagine, that as great a Value may perhaps come in from Forein Princes to their Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners here, for Favours or Intelligence, which ſome States account good Policy, to purchaſe with great Liberality; the Receipt whereof, notwithſtanding, is plain Treachery.</p>
                  <p>There are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et ſome other petty things which ſeem to have reference to this Ballance, of which the ſaid Officers of His Majeſty's Cuſtoms can take no notice, to bring them into the Accompt. As namely, the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Travellers, the Gifts to Ambaſſadors and Strangers, the Fraud of ſome Rich Goods not entred into the Cuſtom-Houſe, the Gain which is made here by Strangers by Change and Re-change, Intereſt of Mony, Inſurance upon Engliſhmens Goods and their Lives: Which can be little when the Charges of their living here is deducted; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the very like Advantages are as amply miniſtred unto the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in Forein Countries, which doth counterpoize all theſe things, and therefore they are not conſiderable in the drawing up of the ſaid Ballance.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXI. The Concluſion upon all that hath been ſaid, concerning the Exportation or Importation of Treaſure.</head>
                  <p>THE Sum of all that hath been ſpoken, concerning the Enriching of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Increaſe of our Treaſure by Commerce with Strangers, is briefly thus. That it is a certain Rule in our Forein Trade in thoſe Places where our Commodities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, are over-ballanced in value by Forein Wares brought into this Realm, there our Mony is under-valued in Exchange; and where the contrary of this is performed, there our Mony is over-valued in Exchange; and where the contrary of this is performed, there our Mony is over-valued. But let the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Exchange be at a high Rate, or at a low Rate, or at the <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> or put down altogether; Let Forein Princes enhance their Coins, or debaſe their Standards, and let His Majeſty do the like, or keep them conſtant, as they now ſtand; Let Forein Coins paſs current here in all Payments, at higher Rates than they are worth at the Mint; Let the Statute for Employments by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſtand in force, or be repealed; Let the meer Exchanger do his worth; Let Princes Oppreſs, Lawyers Extort, Uſerers Bite, Prodigals Waſt; and laſtly, Let Merchants carry out what Mony they ſhall have occaſion to uſe in Traffick. Yet all theſe Actions can work no other Effects in the courſe of Trade, than is declared in this Diſcourſe. For ſo much Treaſure only will be brought in or carried out of a Common-wealth, as the Forein Trade doth Over or Under-ballance in value. And this muſt come to paſs by a Neceſſity beyound all reſiſtance. So that all other Courſes, (which tend not to this End) howſoever they may ſeem to force Mony into a Kingdom for a time, yet are they (in the End) not only fruitleſs but alſo hurtful: They are like to Violent Floods which bear down their Banks, and ſuddenly remain dry again for want of Waters.</p>
                  <p>Behold then the true Form and Worth of Forein Trade, which is,
<hi>The great Revenue of the King; The Honour of the Kingdom; The Noble Profeſſion of the Merchant; The School of our Arts; The Supply of our Wants; The Employment of our Poor; The Improvement of our Lands; The Nurſery of our Mariners; The Walls of the Kingdoms; The Means of our Treaſure; The Sinews of our Wars; The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of out Enemies.</hi> For all which great and weighty Reaſons, do ſo many well governed States highly countenance the Profeſſion, and carefully cheriſh the Action; not only with Policy to Increaſe it, but alſo with Power to protect it from all Forein Injuries: Becauſe they know it is a Principle in Reaſon of State, To Maintain and Defend that which doth Support them and their Eſtates.</p>
